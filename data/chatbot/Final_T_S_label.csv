382,what is.  polycystic kidney disease.,"polycystic kidney disease is a disorder that affects the kidneys and other organs. clusters of fluid-filled sacs, called cysts, develop in the kidneys and interfere with their ability to filter waste products from the blood. the growth of cysts causes the kidneys to become enlarged and can lead to kidney failure. cysts may also develop in other organs, particularly the liver. frequent complications of polycystic kidney disease include dangerously high blood pressure. , pain the back or sides, blood in the urine. , recurrent urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and heart valve abnormalities. additionally, people with polycystic kidney disease have an increased risk of an abnormal bulging.  in a large blood vessel called the aorta or in blood vessels at the base of the brain. aneurysms can be life-threatening if they tear or rupture. the two major forms of polycystic kidney disease are distinguished by the usual age of onset and the pattern in which it is passed through families. the autosomal dominant form.  has signs and symptoms that typically begin adulthood, although cysts in the kidney are often present from birth or childhood. autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease can be further divided into type 1 and type 2, depending on the genetic cause. the autosomal recessive form of polycystic kidney disease.  is much rarer and is often lethal early in life. the signs and symptoms of this condition are usually apparent at birth or in early infancy.)",4,0
383,what are the genetic changes related to polycystic kidney disease.,"mutations in the pkd1, pkd2, and pkhd1 genes cause polycystic kidney disease. mutations in either the pkd1 or pkd2 gene can cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; pkd1 gene mutations cause adpkd type 1, and pkd2 gene mutations cause adpkd type 2. these genes provide instructions for making proteins whose functions are not fully understood. researchers believe that they are involved in transmitting chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. the two proteins work together to promote normal kidney development, organization, and function. mutations in the pkd1 or pkd2 gene lead to the formation of thousands of cysts, which disrupt the normal functions of the kidneys and other organs. people with mutations in the pkd2 gene, particularly women, typically have a less severe form of the disease than people with pkd1 mutations. the signs and symptoms, including a decline in kidney function, tend to appear later in adulthood in people with a pkd2 mutation. mutations in the pkhd1 gene cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. this gene provides instructions for making a protein whose exact function is unknown; however, the protein likely transmits chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell nucleus. researchers have not determined how mutations in the pkhd1 gene lead to the formation of numerous cysts characteristic of polycystic kidney disease. although polycystic kidney disease is usually a genetic disorder, a small percentage of cases are not caused by gene mutations. these cases are called acquired polycystic kidney disease. this form of the disorder occurs most often in people with other types of kidney disease who have been treated for several years with hemodialysis..)",4,0
384,is polycystic kidney disease inherited.,"most cases of polycystic kidney disease have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. people with this condition are born with one mutated copy of the pkd1 or pkd2 gene in each cell. in about 90 percent of these cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. the other 10 percent of cases result from a new mutation in one of the genes and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. although one altered copy of a gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder, an additional mutation in the second copy of the pkd1 or pkd2 gene may make cysts grow faster and increase the severity of the disease. the rate at which cysts enlarge and cause a loss of kidney function varies widely, and may be influenced by mutations in other genes that have not been identified. polycystic kidney disease also can be inherited in autosomal recessive pattern. people with this form of the condition have two altered copies of the pkhd1 gene in each cell. the parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are not affected but are carriers of one copy of the altered gene.)",4,0

393,what is.  celiac disease.,"celiac disease is a condition in which the immune system is abnormally sensitive to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder; autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. without a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet, inflammation resulting from immune system overactivity may cause a wide variety of signs and symptoms involving many parts of the body. celiac disease can develop at any age after an individual starts eating foods containg gluten. the classic symptoms of the condition result from inflammation affecting the gastrointestinal tract. this inflammation damages the villi, which are small, finger-like projections that line the small intestine and provide a greatly increased surface area to absorb nutrients. in celiac disease, the villi become shortened and eventually flatten out. intestinal damage causes diarrhea and poor absorption of nutrients, which may lead to weight loss. abdominal pain, swelling. , and food intolerances are common in celiac disease. inflammation associated with celiac disease may lead to an increased risk of developing certain gastrointestinal cancers such as cancers of the small intestine or esophagus. inflammation and poor nutrient absorption may lead to problems affecting many other organs and systems of the body in affected individuals. these health problems may include iron deficiency that results in a low number of red blood cells. , vitamin deficiencies, low bone mineral density. , itchy skin rashes. , defects in the enamel of the teeth, chronic fatigue, joint pain, poor growth, delayed puberty, infertility, or repeated miscarriages. neurological problems have also been associated with celiac disease; these include migraine headaches, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. , and recurrent seizures.. many people with celiac disease have one or more of these varied health problems but do not have gastrointestinal symptoms. this form of the condition is called nonclassic celiac disease. researchers now believe that nonclassic celiac disease is actually more common than the classic form. celiac disease often goes undiagnosed because many of its signs and symptoms are nonspecific, which means they may occur in many disorders. most people who have one or more of these nonspecific health problems do not have celiac disease. on average, a diagnosis of celiac disease is not made until 6 to 10 years after symptoms begin. some people have silent celiac disease, in which they have no symptoms of the disorder. however, people with silent celiac disease do have immune proteins in their blood.  that are common in celiac disease. they also have inflammatory damage to their small intestine that can be detected with a biopsy. in a small number of cases, celiac disease does not improve with a gluten-free diet and progresses to a condition called refractory sprue. refractory sprue is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption of nutrients, and an increased risk of developing a type of cancer of the immune cells called t-cell lymphoma.)",4,0

395,what are the genetic changes related to celiac disease.,"the risk of developing celiac disease is increased by certain variants of the hla-dqa1 and hla-dqb1 genes. these genes provide instructions for making proteins that play a critical role in the immune system. the hla-dqa1 and hla-dqb1 genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen.  complex. the hla complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria. the proteins produced from the hla-dqa1 and hla-dqb1 genes attach.  to each other to form a functional protein complex called antigen-binding dq heterodimer. this complex, which is present on the surface of certain immune system cells, attaches to protein fragments.  outside the cell. if the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign. , it triggers a response to attack the invading viruses or bacteria. celiac disease is associated with an inappropriate immune response to a segment of the gluten protein called gliadin. this inappropriate activation of the immune system causes inflammation that damages the body's organs and tissues and leads to the signs and symptoms of celiac disease. almost all people with celiac disease have specific variants of the hla-dqa1 and hla-dqb1 genes, which seem to increase the risk of an inappropriate immune response to gliadin. however, these variants are also found in 30 percent of the general population, and only 3 percent of individuals with the gene variants develop celiac disease. it appears likely that other contributors, such as environmental factors and changes in other genes, also influence the development of this complex disorder.)",2,2

844,what are the genetic changes related to beckwith-wiedemann syndrome.,"the genetic causes of beckwith-wiedemann syndrome are complex. the condition usually results from the abnormal regulation of genes in a particular region of chromosome 11. people normally inherit one copy of this chromosome from each parent. for most genes on chromosome 11, both copies of the gene are expressed, or ""turned on,"" in cells. for some genes, however, only the copy inherited from a person's father.  is expressed. for other genes, only the copy inherited from a person's mother.  is expressed. these parent-specific differences in gene expression are caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. abnormalities involving genes on chromosome 11 that undergo genomic imprinting are responsible for most cases of beckwith-wiedemann syndrome. at least half of all cases result from changes in a process called methylation. methylation is a chemical reaction that attaches small molecules called methyl groups to certain segments of dna. in genes that undergo genomic imprinting, methylation is one way that a gene's parent of origin is marked during the formation of egg and sperm cells. beckwith-wiedemann syndrome is often associated with changes in regions of dna on chromosome 11 called imprinting centers.. ics control the methylation of several genes that are involved in normal growth, including the cdkn1c, h19, igf2, and kcnq1ot1 genes. abnormal methylation disrupts the regulation of these genes, which leads to overgrowth and the other characteristic features of beckwith-wiedemann syndrome. about twenty percent of cases of beckwith-wiedemann syndrome are caused by a genetic change known as paternal uniparental disomy.. paternal upd causes people to have two active copies of paternally inherited genes rather than one active copy from the father and one inactive copy from the mother. people with paternal upd are also missing genes that are active only on the maternally inherited copy of the chromosome. in beckwith-wiedemann syndrome, paternal upd usually occurs early in embryonic development and affects only some of the body's cells. this phenomenon is called mosaicism. mosaic paternal upd leads to an imbalance in active paternal and maternal genes on chromosome 11, which underlies the signs and symptoms of the disorder. less commonly, mutations in the cdkn1c gene cause beckwith-wiedemann syndrome. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control growth before birth. mutations in the cdkn1c gene prevent this protein from restraing growth, which leads to the abnormalities characteristic of beckwith-wiedemann syndrome. about 1 percent of all people with beckwith-wiedemann syndrome have a chromosomal abnormality such as a rearrangement. , abnormal copying. , or loss.  of genetic material from chromosome 11. like the other genetic changes responsible for beckwith-wiedemann syndrome, these abnormalities disrupt the normal regulation of certain genes on this chromosome.)",2,2

977,what causes down syndrome.,"what causes down syndrome? there are 3 possible genetic causes of down syndrome: trisomy 21. most often, down syndrome is caused by an extra chromosome 21 in all cells of the affected person. in these cases, the chromosome 21 pair fails to separate during the formation of an egg. ; this called ""nondisjunction."" when the egg with 2 copies of chromosome 21 unites with a normal sperm with one copy of chromosome 21 to form an embryo, the resulting embryo has 3 copies of chromosome 21 instead of the normal two. the extra chromosome is then copied in every cell of the baby's body, causing the features of down syndrome. the cause of nondisjunction is unknown, but research has shown that it happens more often as women age. nondisjunction is not known to be caused by anything in the environment or anything that parents do.  before or during pregnancy. mosaic trisomy 21. in about 1-2% of cases, only some of the cells in a person's body have an extra chromosome 21; this called ""mosaic trisomy 21. in this situation, the fertilized egg may have the right number of chromosomes, but due to a cell division error early in the development of the embryo, some cells ""acquire"" an extra chromosome 21. a person with mosaic trisomy 21 typically has 46 chromosomes in some cells, and 47 chromosomes.  in others. the features and severity in people with mosaic trisomy 21 may vary widely. translocation trisomy 21. about 3-4% of people with down syndrome have cells that contain 46 chromosomes; however, there is extra chromosome 21 material attached.  onto another chromosome. for parents of a child with down syndrome due to a translocation, there may be an increased chance of down syndrome in future pregnancies. this because one of the two parents may be a carrier of a balanced translocation. however, not all parents of people with translocation trisomy 21 have a translocation. regardless of the type of down syndrome a person has, all people with down syndrome have an extra, critical portion of chromosome 21 present in all or some of their cells. this extra genetic material disrupts the normal course of development, causing the characteristic features of down syndrome.)",2,0
978,what are the genetic changes related to down syndrome.,"most cases of down syndrome result from trisomy 21, which means each cell in the body has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two copies. less commonly, down syndrome occurs when part of chromosome 21 becomes attached.  to another chromosome during the formation of reproductive cells.  in a parent or very early in fetal development. affected people have two normal copies of chromosome 21 plus extra material from chromosome 21 attached to another chromosome, resulting in three copies of genetic material from chromosome 21. affected individuals with this genetic change are said to have translocation down syndrome. a very small percentage of people with down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21 in only some of the body's cells. in these people, the condition is called mosaic down syndrome. researchers believe that having extra copies of genes on chromosome 21 disrupts the course of normal development, causing the characteristic features of down syndrome and the increased risk of health problems associated with this condition.)",2,0

1066,what are the genetic changes related to bladder cancer.,"as with most cancers, the exact causes of bladder cancer are not known; however, many risk factors are associated with this disease. many of the major risk factors are environmental, such as smoking and exposure to certain industrial chemicals. studies suggest that chronic bladder inflammation, a parasitic infection called schistosomiasis, and some medications used to treat cancer are other environmental risk factors associated with bladder cancer. genetic factors are also likely to play an important role in determing bladder cancer risk. researchers have studied the effects of mutations in several genes, including fgfr3, rb1, hras, tp53, and tsc1, on the formation and growth of bladder tumors. each of these genes plays a critical role in regulating cell division by preventing cells from dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. alterations in these genes may help explain why some bladder cancers grow and spread more rapidly than others. deletions of part or all of chromosome 9 are common events in bladder tumors. researchers believe that several genes that control cell growth and division are probably located on chromosome 9. they are working to determine whether a loss of these genes plays a role in the development and progression of bladder cancer. most of the genetic changes associated with bladder cancer develop in bladder tissue during a person's lifetime, rather than being inherited from a parent. some people, however, appear to inherit a reduced ability to break down certain chemicals, which makes them more sensitive to the cancer-causing effects of tobacco smoke and industrial chemicals.)",5,0

1114,do you have information about aging changes in the heart and blood vessels.,"some changes in the heart and blood vessels normally occur with age, but many other changes that are common with aging are due to modifiable factors that, if not treated, can lead to heart disease. background the heart has two sides. the right side pumps blood to the lungs to receive oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide. the left side pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body. blood flows out of the heart through arteries, which branch out and get smaller and smaller as they go into the tissues. in the tissues, they become tiny capillaries. capillaries are where the blood gives up oxygen and nutrients to the tissues, and receives carbon dioxide and wastes back from the tissues. then, the vessels begin to collect together into larger and larger veins, which return blood to the heart. watch this video about: blood flow aging changes heart: - the heart has a natural pacemaker system that controls the heartbeat. some of the pathways of this system may develop fibrous tissue and fat deposits. the natural pacemaker.  loses some of its cells. these changes may result in a slightly slower heart rate. - a slight increase in the size of the heart, especially the left ventricle, is not uncommon. the heart wall thickens, so the amount of blood that the chamber can hold may actually decrease despite the increased overall heart size. the heart may fill more slowly. - heart changes cause the ecg of a normal, healthy older person to be slightly different than the ecg of a healthy younger adult. abnormal rhythms. , such as atrial fibrillation, are more common in older people. they may be caused by heart disease. - normal changes in the heart include deposits of the ""aging pigment,"" lipofuscin. the heart muscle cells degenerate slightly. the valves inside the heart, which control the direction of blood flow, thicken and become stiffer. a heart mur caused by valve stiffness is fairly common in the elderly. blood vessels: - receptors called baroreceptors monitor the blood pressure and make changes to help maintain a fairly constant blood pressure when a person changes positions or is doing other activities. the baroreceptors become less sensitive with aging. this may explain why many older people have orthostatic hypotension, a condition in which the blood pressure falls when a person goes from lying or sitting to standing. this causes dizziness because there is less blood flow to the brain. - the capillary walls thicken slightly. this may cause a slightly slower rate of exchange of nutrients and wastes. - the main artery from the heart.  becomes thicker, stiffer, and less flexible. this probably related to changes in the connective tissue of the blood vessel wall. this makes the blood pressure higher and makes the heart work harder, which may lead to thickening of the heart muscle.. the other arteries also thicken and stiffen. in general, most elderly people have a moderate increase in blood pressure. blood: - the blood itself changes slightly with age. normal aging causes a reduction in total body water. as part of this, there is less fluid in the bloodstream, so blood volume decreases. - the speed with which red blood cells are produced in response to stress or illness is reduced. this creates a slower response to blood loss and anemia. - most of the white blood cells stay at the same levels, although certain white blood cells important to immunity.  decrease in their number and ability to fight off bacteria. this reduces the ability to resist infection. effect of changes normally, the heart continues to pump enough blood to supply all parts of the body. however, an older heart may not be able to pump blood as well when you make it work harder. some of the things that make your heart work harder are: - certain medicines - emotional stress - physical exertion - illness - infections - injuries common problems - angina. , shortness of breath with exertion, and heart attack can result from coronary artery disease. - abnormal heart rhythms.  of various types can occur. - anemia may occur, possibly related to malnutrition, chronic infections, blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract, or as a complication of other diseases or medicines. - arteriosclerosis.  is very common. fatty plaque deposits inside the blood vessels cause them to narrow and totally block blood vessels. - congestive heart failure is also very common in the elderly. in people older than 75, congestive heart failure occurs 10 times more often than in younger adults. - coronary artery disease is fairly common. it is often a result of arteriosclerosis. - high blood pressure and orthostatic hypotension are more common with older age. elderly people on blood pressure medicines need to work with their doctor to find the best way to manage their high blood pressure. this because too much medicine may cause low blood pressure and could lead to a fall. - heart valve diseases are fairly common. aortic stenosis, or narrowing of the aortic valve, is the most common valve disease in the elderly. - transient ischemic attacks.  or strokes can occur if blood flow to the brain is disrupted. other problems with the heart and blood vessels include the following: - blood clots - deep vein thrombosis - thrombophlebitis - peripheral vascular disease, resulting intermittent pain the legs when walking.  - varicose veins - aneurysms may develop in one of the major arteries from the heart or in the brain. aneurysms are an abnormal widening or ballooning of a part of an artery due to weakness in the wall of the blood vessel. if aneurysm bursts it may cause bleeding and death. prevention - you can help your circulatory system.. heart disease risk factors that you have some control over include high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes, obesity, and smoking. - eat a heart-healthy diet with reduced amounts of saturated fat and cholesterol, and control your weight. follow your health care provider's recommendations for treating high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes. reduce or stop smoking. - men between the ages of 65 to 75 who have ever smoked should be screened for aneurysms in their abdominal aorta. get more exercise: - exercise may help prevent obesity, and it helps people with diabetes control their blood sugar. - exercise may help you maintain your abilities as much as possible, and it reduces stress. - moderate exercise is one of the best things you can do to keep your heart, and the rest of your body, healthy. consult with your provider before beginning a new exercise program. exercise moderately and within your capabilities, but do it regularly. - people who exercise usually have less body fat and smoke less than people who do not exercise. they also tend to have fewer blood pressure problems and less heart disease. have regular check-ups for your heart: - have your blood pressure checked every year. if you have diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other conditions, your blood pressure may need to be monitored more closely. - if your cholesterol level is normal, have it rechecked every 5 years. if you have diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other conditions, your cholesterol may need to be monitored more closely. - if you are an older man.  and you have a history of smoking, you should be screened for aneurysms in one of the major arteries of the heart.)",3,0

1136,do you have information about child safety seats.,"child safety seats are proven to save children's lives in accidents. in the united states, all states require children to be secured in a car seat or booster seat until they are 4' 9"" tall. most children grow to this height when they are between 8 and 12 years old. to keep your child safe, keep these tips in mind when using a car safety seat. - when your child is born, you must have a car seat to bring the baby home from the hospital. - always secure your child in a car seat whenever riding in a vehicle. make sure the harness is fastened snugly. - read the car seat manufacturer's instructions for the proper way to use the seat. read your vehicle owner's manual, too. - car seats and booster seats should always be used on the back seat of a vehicle. if there is no back seat, the car seat can be secured on the front passenger seat. this can only be done when there is no front or side air bag, or the air bag has been switched off. when you are selecting a child safety seat for the first time: - the seat must fit your child's size and be able to be properly installed in your vehicle. - it is best to use a new car seat. used car seats often do not have instructions. they may have cracks or other problems that make the seat unsafe. for example, the seat may have been damaged during a car accident. - try the seat before buying it. install the seat in your vehicle. put your child in the car seat. secure the harness and buckle. check that the seat fits your vehicle and child. - do not use a car seat past its expiration date. the seat frame may no longer be strong enough to support your child safely. the expiration date is usually on the bottom of the seat. - do not use a seat that has been recalled. fill out and send in the registration card that comes with the new car seat. the manufacturer can contact you if the seat is recalled. you can find out about recalls by contacting the manufacturer, or by looking up safety complaints records on your child's safety seat w. safercar. gov/parents/car. seats/car-seat-safety. htm. the types of child safety seats and restraints include: - rear-facing seats - forward-facing seats - booster seats - car beds - built-in car seats - travel vests rear-facing seats a rear-facing seat is one in which your child faces the back of the vehicle. the seat should be installed on the back seat of your vehicle. the two types of rear-facing seats are the infant-only seat and the convertible seat. infant-only rear-facing seats. these seats are for babies who weigh up to 22 to 30 pounds, depending on the car seat. you will need a new seat when your child gets bigger. infant-only seats have handles so you can carry the seat to and from the car. some have a base you can leave installed in the car. this lets you click the car seat into place each time you use it. follow manufacturer's instructions on how the seat should be reclined so your baby's head does not shift around while you are driving. convertible seats. these seats are to be placed in the rear-facing position and are for infants and toddlers. when your child is older and bigger, the seat can be switched to the forward-facing position. experts recommend keeping your child rear-facing until at least age 2 and until your child outgrows the weight or height allowed by the seat. forward-facing seats a forward-facing seat should be installed on the back seat of your vehicle, although it allows your child to face the front of the car. these seats are used only after your child is too big for a rear-facing seat. a combination forward-facing booster seat may also be used. for younger children, the booster seat's harness straps should be used. after your child reaches the upper height and weight limit for the harness. , the vehicle's own lap and shoulder belts can be used to keep your child strapped in. booster seats a booster seat raises your child up so the vehicle's own lap and shoulder belts fit correctly. the lap belt should fall across your child's upper thighs. the shoulder belt should go across the middle of your child's shoulder and chest. use booster seats for older children until they are 4' 9"" tall and between 8 and 12 years old. car beds these seats are also called flat car seats. they are used for premature or other special-needs babies. the american academy of pediatrics recommends having a health care provider look at how your preterm baby fits and breathes in a car seat before leaving the hospital. built-in seats some vehicles have built-in car seats. weight and height limits vary. you can get more details on these seats by reading the vehicle owner's manual or calling the vehicle manufacturer. travel vests special vests can be worn by older children who have outgrown forward-facing safety seats. the vests can be used instead of booster seats. the vests are used with the vehicle's lap and seat belts. as with car seats, children should be sitting in the back seat when using the vest.)",0,2

1139,what are the symptoms of contact dermatis.,"symptoms vary depending on the cause and whether the dermatis is due to an allergic reaction or an irritant. the same person may also have different symptoms over time. allergic reactions may occur suddenly, or develop after months of exposure. contact dermatis often occurs on the hands. hair products, cosmetics, and perfumes can lead to skin reactions on the face, head, and neck. jewelry can also cause skin problems in the area under it. itching is a common symptom. in the case of an allergic dermatis, itching can be severe. you may have red, streaky, or patchy rash where the substance touched the skin. the allergic reaction is often delayed so that the rash may not appear until 24 to 48 hours after exposure. the rash may: - have red bumps that may form moist, weeping blisters - feel warm and tender - ooze, drain, or crust - become scaly, raw, or thickened dermatis caused by an irritant may also cause burning or pain as well as itching. irritant dermatis often shows as dry, red, and rough skin. cuts.  may form on the hands. skin may become inflamed with long-term exposure.)",6,0
1140,how to diagnose contact dermatis.,"your health care provider will make the diagnosis based on how the skin looks and by asking questions about substances you may have come in contact with. allergy testing with skin patches.  may determine what is causing the reaction. patch testing is used for certain people who have long-term or repeated contact dermatis. it requires 3 office visits and must be done by a provider with the skill to interpret the results correctly. - on the first visit, small patches of possible allergens are applied to the skin. these patches are removed 48 hours later to see if a reaction has occurred. - a third visit, about 2 days later, is done to look for any delayed reaction. - if you have already tested a material on a small area of your skin and noticed a reaction, you should bring the material with you. other tests may be used to rule out other possible causes, including skin lesion biopsy or culture of the skin lesion.)",5,0
1141,what are the treatments for contact dermatis.,"your doctor will recommend treatment based on what is causing the problem. in some cases, the best treatment is to do nothing to the area. often, treatment includes washing the area with a lot of water to get rid of any traces of the irritant that are still on the skin. you should avoid further exposure to the substance. emollients or moisturizers help keep the skin moist, and also help skin repair itself. they protect the skin from becoming inflamed again. they are a key part of preventing and treating contact dermatis. topical corticosteroids are medicines used to treat eczema. - topical means you place it on the skin. you will be prescribed a cream or ointment. topical corticosteroids may also be called topical steroids or topical cortisones. - do not use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor advises you to use it. your provider may also prescribe other creams or ointments, such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus, to use on the skin. in severe cases, you may need to take corticosteroid pills. your provider will start you on a high dose and your dose will be slowly reduced over about 12 days. you may also receive a corticosteroid shot. wet dressings and soothing anti-itch.  lotions may be recommended to reduce other symptoms.)",3,0
1142,what is the outlook for contact dermatis.,"contact dermatis clears up without complications in 2 or 3 weeks in most cases. however, it may return if the substance that caused it cannot be found or avoided. you may need to change your job or job habits if the disorder is caused by exposure at work. sometimes, the allergen causing the reaction is never identified.)",5,0

1181,what is.  congenital diaphragmatic hernia.,"congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a defect in the diaphragm. the diaphragm, which is composed of muscle and other fibrous tissue, separates the organs in the abdomen from those in the chest. abnormal development of the diaphragm before birth leads to defects ranging from a thinned area in the diaphragm to its complete absence. an absent or partially formed diaphragm results in abnormal opening.  that allows the stomach and intestines to move into the chest cavity and crowd the heart and lungs. this crowding can lead to underdevelopment of the lungs. , potentially resulting in life-threatening breathing difficulties that are apparent from birth. in 5 to 10 percent of affected individuals, signs and symptoms of congenital diaphragmatic hernia appear later in life and may include breathing problems or abdominal pain from protrusion of the intestine into the chest cavity. in about 1 percent of cases, congenital diaphragmatic hernia has no symptoms; it may be detected incidentally when medical imaging is done for other reasons. congenital diaphragmatic hernias are often classified by their position. a bochdalek hernia is a defect in the side or back of the diaphragm. between 80 and 90 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernias are of this type. a morgnani hernia is a defect involving the front part of the diaphragm. this type of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which accounts for approximately 2 percent of cases, is less likely to cause severe symptoms at birth. other types of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, such as those affecting the central region of the diaphragm, or those in which the diaphragm muscle is absent with only a thin membrane in its place, are rare.)",5,0

shingles is caused by a reactivation of the chickenpox virus. it is distinctive because it affects only one side of the body. the early signs of shingles usually develop in three stages: severe pain or tingling, possibly itchy rash, and blisters that look like chickenpox. the virus that causes shingles is a herpes virus.  once you are infected with this kind of virus, it remains in your body for life. it stays inactive until a period when your immunity is down. shingles and pain the most common complication of shingles is pain - a condition called post-herpetic neuralgia.. people with phn have severe pain the areas where they had the shingles rash, even after the rash clears up. in most patients, the pain usually clears up in a few weeks or months, but some people can have pain from phn for years. persistent pain from shingles is a common symptom in people over 60. in fact, one out of six people older than 60 years who get shingles will have severe pain. as people get older, they are more likely to develop long-term pain as a complication of shingles and the pain is likely to be more severe. other complications shingles may also lead to other serious complications. - outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected. - bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring. outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected. bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring. - in a very small number of cases, bacteria can cause more serious conditions, including toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis, a severe infection that destroys the soft tissue under the skin. - the burning waves of pain, loss of sleep, and interference with even basic life activities can cause serious depression. - in patients with immune deficiency, the rash can be much more extensive than usual and the illness can be complicated by pneumonia. these cases are more serious, but they are rarely fatal. - very rarely, shingles can also lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation. , or death. in a very small number of cases, bacteria can cause more serious conditions, including toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis, a severe infection that destroys the soft tissue under the skin. the burning waves of pain, loss of sleep, and interference with even basic life activities can cause serious depression. in patients with immune deficiency, the rash can be much more extensive than usual and the illness can be complicated by pneumonia. these cases are more serious, but they are rarely fatal. very rarely, shingles can also lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation. , or death. shingles usually does not return people who develop shingles usually have only one episode in their lifetime. however, a person can have a second or even a third episode. the shingles vaccine adults 60 years old or older should talk to their healthcare professional about getting a one-time dose of the shingles vaccine. the vaccine can reduce your risk of shingles and the long-term pain it can cause. if you have already had shingles or you have a chronic medical condition, you can receive the shingles vaccine.  is shingles contagious? shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. however, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. in such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. the virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. a person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister phase. a person is not infectious before the blisters appear. once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered. if you have shingles, - keep the rash covered - avoid touching or scratching the rash - wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus. keep the rash covered avoid touching or scratching the rash wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus. until your rash has developed crusts, avoid contact with - pregnant women who have never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine - premature or low birth weight infants - people with weakened immune systems, such as people receiving immunosuppressive medications or undergoing chemotherapy, organ transplant recipients, and people with human immunodeficiency virus.  infection. pregnant women who have never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine premature or low birth weight infants people with weakened immune systems, such as people receiving immunosuppressive medications or undergoing chemotherapy, organ transplant recipients, and people with human immunodeficiency virus.  infection. if you have not had chickenpox and you come into contact with someone who has shingles, ask your healthcare provider whether you should get a chickenpox vaccination. to learn more, see ""what you need to know about shingles and the shingles vaccine."")",6,0

1221,what causes developmental disorders of the female reproductive tract ?,"a baby starts to develop its reproductive organs between weeks 4 and 5 of pregnancy. this development continues until the 20th week of pregnancy. the development is a complex process. many different things can interrupt the process. how severe your baby's problem is depends on when the interruption occurred. in general, the earlier development problems occur in the womb, the more serious the problem. problems in the development of a girl's reproductive organs may be caused by: - broken or missing genes.  - use of certain drugs during pregnancy for example, some babies may have a genetic defect that prevents their body from producing a substance called 21-hydroxylase. if a developing baby girl lacks this substance, she will be born with a uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes, but her external genitals will look like those found on boys. see: congenital adrenal hyperplasia certain drugs that the mother takes can pass into the baby's bloodstream and interfere with organ development. one drug known to do this diethylstilbestrol.. doctors once prescribed this medicine to pregnant women to prevent miscarriage and early labor. however, scientists learned that baby girls born to women who took this drug had an abnormally shaped uterus. the drug also increased the daughters' chances of developing a rare form of vaginal cancer. sometimes, a developmental disorder can be seen as soon as the baby is born. it may cause life-threatening conditions in the newborn. other times, the condition is not diagnosed until the girl is older. the reproductive tract develops close to the urinary tract and kidneys. it also develops at the same time as several other organs. as a result, developmental problems in the female reproductive tract sometimes occur with problems in other areas, including the urinary tract, kidneys, and lower spine. developmental disorders of the female reproductive tract include intersex and ambiguous genitalia. see the specific articles for information these conditions. other developmental disorders of the female reproductive tract include: - cloacal abnormalities - the cloaca is a tube-like structure. in the early stages of a baby's development, the urinary tract, rectum, and vagina all empty into this one tube. but, later in development, the three areas separate and have their own openings. if the cloaca persists a baby girl grows in the womb, all the openings do not form. for example, a baby may be born with only one opening on the bottom of the body near the rectal area. urine and feces cannot drain out of the body. this can cause severe pain, stomach swelling, and breathing problems. some cloacal abnormalities may cause a baby girl to look like she has a male's penis. these birth defects are rare. - problems with outer.  genitals - developmental problems may lead to a swollen clitoris or fused labia.. most other problems of the outer genitals are related to intersex or ambiguous genitalia. - imperforate hymen - the hymen is a thin tissue that partly covers the opening to the vagina. an imperforate hymen completely blocks the vaginal opening. this often leads to painful swelling of the vagina. sometimes, the hymen has only a very small opening or tiny small holes. this problem may not be discovered until puberty. some baby girls are born without a hymen. - ovarian problems - a baby girl may have an extra ovary, extra tissue attached to an ovary, or structures called ovotes that have both male and female tissue. - uterus and cervix problems- a baby girl may be born with an extra cervix and uterus, a half-formed uterus, or a blockage of the uterus. usually, girls born with half a uterus and half a vagina are missing the kidney on the same side of the body. - vaginal problems- a baby girl may be born without a vagina or have the vaginal opening blocked by a layer of cells that are higher up in the vagina than where the hymen is. a missing vagina is most often due to mayer-rokitansky-kster-hauser syndrome. in this syndrome, the baby is missing part or all of the internal reproductive organs.. other abnormalities include having two vaginas or a vagina that opens into the urinary tract, a heart shaped uterus, and a uterus with a wall in the middle of the cavity)",5,0

1252,what are the genetic changes related to antiphospholipid syndrome.,"the genetic cause of antiphospholipid syndrome is unknown. this condition is associated with the presence of three abnormal immune proteins.  in the blood: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-b2 glycoprotein i. antibodies normally bind to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction, but the antibodies in antiphospholipid syndrome attack normal human proteins. when these antibodies attach.  to proteins, the proteins change shape and bind to other molecules and receptors on the surface of cells. binding to cells, particularly immune cells, turns on.  the blood clotting pathway and other immune responses. the production of lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-b2 glycoprotein i may coincide with exposure to foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, that are similar to normal human proteins. exposure to these foreign invaders may cause the body to produce antibodies to fight the infection, but because the invaders are so similar to the body's own proteins, the antibodies also attack the human proteins. similar triggers may occur during pregnancy when a woman's physiology, particularly her immune system, adapts to accommodate the developing fetus. these changes during pregnancy may explain the high rate of affected females. certain genetic variations.  in a few genes have been found in people with antiphospholipid syndrome and may predispose individuals to produce the specific antibodies known to contribute to the formation of thromboses. however, the contribution of these genetic changes to the development of the condition is unclear. people who test positive for all three antibodies but have not had a thrombosis or recurrent miscarriages are said to be antiphospholipid carriers. these individuals are at greater risk of developing a thrombosis than is the general population.)",2,0
1253,is antiphospholipid syndrome inherited.,"most cases of antiphospholipid syndrome are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. rarely, the condition has been reported to run in families; however, it does not have a clear pattern of inheritance. multiple genetic and environmental factors likely play a part in determing the risk of developing antiphospholipid syndrome.)",5,0

1409,what is.  sick sinus syndrome.,"sick sinus syndrome.  is a group of related heart conditions that can affect how the heart beats. ""sick sinus"" refers to the sino-atrial.  node, which is an area of specialized cells in the heart that functions a natural pacemaker. the sa node generates electrical impulses that start each heartbeat. these signals travel from the sa node to the rest of the heart, signaling the heart.  muscle to contract and pump blood. in people with sick sinus syndrome, the sa node does not function normally. in some cases, it does not produce the right signals to trigger a regular heartbeat. in others, abnormalities disrupt the electrical impulses and prevent them from reaching the rest of the heart. sick sinus syndrome tends to cause the heartbeat to be too slow. , although occasionally the heartbeat is too fast.. in some cases, the heartbeat rapidly switches from being too fast to being too slow, a condition known as tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome. symptoms related to abnormal heartbeats can include dizziness, light-headedness, fainting. , a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest. , and confusion or memory problems. during exercise, many affected individuals experience chest pain, difficulty breathing, or excessive tiredness.. once symptoms of sick sinus syndrome appear, they usually worsen with time. however, some people with the condition never experience any related health problems. sick sinus syndrome occurs most commonly in older adults, although it can be diagnosed in people of any age. the condition increases the risk of several life-threatening problems involving the heart and blood vessels. these include a heart rhythm abnormality called atrial fibrillation, heart failure, cardiac arrest, and stroke.)",5,0
1410,what are the genetic changes related to sick sinus syndrome.,"sick sinus syndrome can result from genetic or environmental factors. in many cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. genetic changes are an uncommon cause of sick sinus syndrome. mutations in two genes, scn5a and hcn4, have been found to cause the condition in a small number of families. these genes provide instructions for making proteins called ion channels that transport positively charged atoms.  into cardiac cells, including cells that make up the sa node. the flow of these ions is essential for creating the electrical impulses that start each heartbeat and coordinate contraction of the cardiac muscle. mutations in these genes reduce the flow of ions, which alters the sa node's ability to create and spread electrical signals. these changes lead to abnormal heartbeats and the other symptoms of sick sinus syndrome. a particular variation in another gene, myh6, appears to increase the risk of developing sick sinus syndrome. the protein produced from the myh6 gene forms part of a larger protein called myosin, which generates the mechanical force need for cardiac muscle to contract. researchers believe that the myh6 gene variation changes the structure of myosin, which can affect cardiac muscle contraction and increase the likelihood of developing an abnormal heartbeat. more commonly, sick sinus syndrome is caused by other factors that alter the structure or function of the sa node. these include a variety of heart conditions, other disorders such as muscular dystrophy, abnormal inflammation, or a shortage of oxygen.. certain medications, such as drugs given to treat abnormal heart rhythms or high blood pressure, can also disrupt sa node function. one of the most common causes of sick sinus syndrome in children is trauma to the sa node, such as damage that occurs during heart surgery. in older adults, sick sinus syndrome is often associated with age-related changes in the heart. over time, the sa node may harden and develop scar-like damage.  that prevents it from working properly.)",5,0

when your child is born, you must have a car seat to bring the baby home from the hospital. - always secure your child in a car seat whenever riding in a vehicle. make sure the harness is fastened snugly. - read the car seat manufacturer's instructions for the proper way to use the seat. read your vehicle owner's manual, too. - car seats and booster seats should always be used on the back seat of a vehicle. if there is no back seat, the car seat can be secured on the front passenger seat. this can only be done when there is no front or side air bag, or the air bag has been switched off. when you are selecting a child safety seat for the first time: - the seat must fit your child's size and be able to be properly installed in your vehicle. - it is best to use a new car seat. used car seats often do not have instructions. they may have cracks or other problems that make the seat unsafe. for example, the seat may have been damaged during a car accident. - try the seat before buying it. install the seat in your vehicle. put your child in the car seat. secure the harness and buckle. check that the seat fits your vehicle and child. - do not use a car seat past its expiration date. the seat frame may no longer be strong enough to support your child safely. the expiration date is usually on the bottom of the seat. -

1494,what is.  progressive familial heart block.,"progressive familial heart block is a genetic condition that alters the normal beating of the heart. a normal heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals that move through the heart in a highly coordinated way. these signals begin a specialized cluster of cells called the sinoatrial node.  located in the heart's upper chambers.. from there, a group of cells called the atrioventricular node carries the electrical signals to another cluster of cells called the bundle of his. this bundle separates into multiple thin spindles called bundle branches, which carry electrical signals into the heart's lower chambers.. electrical impulses move from the sinoatrial node down to the bundle branches, stimulating a normal heartbeat in which the ventricles contract slightly later than the atria. heart block occurs when the electrical signaling is obstructed anywhere from the atria to the ventricles. in people with progressive familial heart block, the condition worsens over time: early in the disorder, the electrical signals are partially blocked, but the block eventually becomes complete, preventing any signals from passing through the heart. partial heart block causes a slow or irregular heartbeat. , and can lead to the buildup of scar tissue.  in the cells that carry electrical impulses. fibrosis contributes to the development of complete heart block, resulting in uncoordinated electrical signaling between the atria and the ventricles and inefficient pumping of blood in the heart. complete heart block can cause a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest. , shortness of breath, fainting. , or sudden cardiac arrest and death. progressive familial heart block can be divided into type i and type ii, with type i being further divided into types ia and ib. these types differ in where in the heart signaling is interrupted and the genetic cause. in types ia and ib, the heart block originates in the bundle branch, and in type ii, the heart block originates in the atrioventricular node. the different types of progressive familial heart block have similar signs and symptoms. most cases of heart block are not genetic and are not considered progressive familial heart block. the most common cause of heart block is fibrosis of the heart, which occurs a normal process of aging. other causes of heart block can include the use of certain medications or an infection of the heart tissue.)",0,0

1503,what is.  progressive familial heart block.,"progressive familial heart block is a genetic condition that alters the normal beating of the heart. a normal heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals that move through the heart in a highly coordinated way. these signals begin a specialized cluster of cells called the sinoatrial node.  located in the heart's upper chambers.. from there, a group of cells called the atrioventricular node carries the electrical signals to another cluster of cells called the bundle of his. this bundle separates into multiple thin spindles called bundle branches, which carry electrical signals into the heart's lower chambers.. electrical impulses move from the sinoatrial node down to the bundle branches, stimulating a normal heartbeat in which the ventricles contract slightly later than the atria. heart block occurs when the electrical signaling is obstructed anywhere from the atria to the ventricles. in people with progressive familial heart block, the condition worsens over time: early in the disorder, the electrical signals are partially blocked, but the block eventually becomes complete, preventing any signals from passing through the heart. partial heart block causes a slow or irregular heartbeat. , and can lead to the buildup of scar tissue.  in the cells that carry electrical impulses. fibrosis contributes to the development of complete heart block, resulting in uncoordinated electrical signaling between the atria and the ventricles and inefficient pumping of blood in the heart. complete heart block can cause a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest. , shortness of breath, fainting. , or sudden cardiac arrest and death. progressive familial heart block can be divided into type i and type ii, with type i being further divided into types ia and ib. these types differ in where in the heart signaling is interrupted and the genetic cause. in types ia and ib, the heart block originates in the bundle branch, and in type ii, the heart block originates in the atrioventricular node. the different types of progressive familial heart block have similar signs and symptoms. most cases of heart block are not genetic and are not considered progressive familial heart block. the most common cause of heart block is fibrosis of the heart, which occurs a normal process of aging. other causes of heart block can include the use of certain medications or an infection of the heart tissue.)",0,0

1743,what is.  myasthenia gravis.,"myasthenia gravis a disorder that causes weakness of the skeletal muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. the weakness most often starts in the muscles around the eyes, causing drooping of the eyelids.  and difficulty coordinating eye movements, which results in blurred or double vision. in a form of the disorder called ocular myasthenia, the weakness remains confined to the eye muscles. in most people with myasthenia gravis, however, additional muscles in the face and neck are affected. affected individuals may have unusual facial expressions, difficulty holding up the head, speech impairment. , and chewing and swallowing problems.  that may lead to choking, gagging, or drooling. other muscles in the body are also affected in some people with myasthenia gravis. the muscles of the arms and legs may be involved, causing affected individuals to have changes in their gait or trouble with lifting objects, rising from a seated position, or climbing stairs. the muscle weakness tends to fluctuate over time; it typically worsens with activity and improves with rest. weakness of the muscles in the chest wall and the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity.  can cause breathing problems in some people with myasthenia gravis. about 10 percent of people with this disorder experience a potentially life-threatening complication in which these respiratory muscles weaken to the point that breathing is dangerously impaired, and the affected individual requires ventilation assistance. this respiratory failure, called a myasthenic cris, may be triggered by stresses such as infections or reactions to medications. people can develop myasthenia gravis at any age. for reasons that are unknown, it is most commonly diagnosed in women younger than age 40 and men older than age 60. it is uncommon in children, but some infants born to women with myasthenia gravis show signs and symptoms of the disorder for the first few days or weeks of life. this temporary occurrence of symptoms is called transient neonatal myasthenia gravis.)",2,0
1744,how many people are affected by myasthenia gravis.,"myasthenia gravis affects about 20 per 100,000 people worldwide. the prevalence has been increasing in recent decades, which likely results from earlier diagnosis and better treatments leading to longer lifespans for affected individuals.)",5,2
1745,what are the genetic changes related to myasthenia gravis.,"researchers believe that variations in particular genes may increase the risk of myasthenia gravis, but the identity of these genes is unknown. many factors likely contribute to the risk of developing this complex disorder. myasthenia gravis an autoimmune disorder, which occurs when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. in myasthenia gravis, the immune system disrupts the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles by producing a protein called antibody that attaches.  to proteins important for nerve signal transmission. antibodies normally bind to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction, but the antibody in myasthenia gravis attacks a normal human protein. in most affected individuals, the antibody targets a protein called acetylcholine receptor. ; in others, the antibodies attack a related protein called muscle-specific kinase.. in both cases, the abnormal antibodies lead to a reduction of available ach. r. the ach. r protein is critical for signaling between nerve and muscle cells, which is necessary for movement. in myasthenia gravis, because of the abnormal immune response, less ach. r is present, which reduces signaling between nerve and muscle cells. these signaling abnormalities lead to decreased muscle movement and the muscle weakness characteristic of this condition. it is unclear why the immune system malfunctions in people with myasthenia gravis. about 75 percent of affected individuals have an abnormally large and overactive thymus, which is a gland located behind the breastbone that plays an important role in the immune system. the thymus sometimes develops tumors.  that are usually noncancerous.. however, the relationship between the thymus problems and the specific immune system malfunction that occurs in myasthenia gravis not well understood. people with myasthenia gravis are at increased risk of developing other autoimmune disorders, including autoimmune thyroid disease and systemic lupus erythematosus. gene variations that affect immune system function likely affect the risk of developing myasthenia gravis and other autoimmune disorders. some families are affected by an inherited disorder with symptoms similar to those of myasthenia gravis, but in which antibodies to the ach. r or mu. sk proteins are not present. this condition, which is not an autoimmune disorder, is called congenital myasthenic syndrome.)",0,0

do not bundle up a child with blankets or extra clothes, even if your child has the chills. this may keep their fever from coming down, or make it higher. - try one layer of lightweight clothing, and one lightweight blanket for sleep. - the room should be comfortable, not too hot or too cool. if the room is hot or stuffy, a fan may help. acetaminophen.  and ibuprofen.  help lower fever in children. sometimes, your provider will tell you to use both types of medicine. - know how much your child weighs, and then always check the instructions on the package. - give acetaminophen every 4to 6 hours. - give ibuprofen every 6to 8 hours. do not use ibuprofen in children younger than 6 months old. - never give aspirin to children unless your child's provider tells you to use it. a fever does not need to come all the way down to normal. most children will feel better when the temperature drops by even 1 degree. - a lukewarm bath or sponge bath may help cool a fever. it works better if the child also is given medicine - otherwise the temperature might bounce right back up. - do not use cold baths, ice, or alcohol rubs. these often cause shivering and make things worse. what about feeding my child when he or she is sick? your child can eat foods while having a fever, but do not force the child to eat. encourage your child to drink fluids to prevent dehydration. children with the flu often do better with bland foods. a bland diet is made up of foods that are soft, not very spicy, and low in fiber. you may try: - breads, crackers, and pasta made with refined white flour - refined hot cereals, such as oatmeal and cream of wheat - fruit juices that are diluted by mixing half water and half juice. do not give your child too much fruit or apple juice. - frozen fruit popsor gelatin.  are good choices, especially if the child is vomiting. will my child need antivirals or other medicines? children aged 2 to 4 years without high-risk conditions and with mild illness may not need antiviral treatment. children 5 years and older will often not be given antivirals unless they have another high-risk condition. when need, these medicines work best if started within 48 hours after symptoms begin, if possible. either oseltamivir.  or zanamivir.  are used. - oseltamivir comes a capsule or in a liquid. - zanamivir is taken by inhaler. serious side effects from these medicines are quite rare. health care providers and parents must balance the risk for rare side effects against the risk that their children can become quite sick and even die from the flu. talk to your provider before giving any over-the-counter cold medicines to your child. when should my child see a doctor visit an emergency room? talk to your child's provider or go the emergency room if: - your child does not act alert or more comfortable when their fever goes down. - fever and flu symptoms come back after they had gone away. - there are no tears when they're crying. should my child get vaccinated against the flu? even if your child has had a flu-like illness, they should still get the flu vaccine. all children 6 months or older should receive the vaccine. children under 9 years will need a second flu vaccine around 4 weeks after receiving the vaccine for the first time. there are two types of flu vaccine. one is given as a shot, and the other is sprayed into your child's nose. - the flu shot contains killed.  viruses. it is not possible to get the flu from this type of vaccine. the flu shot is approved for people age 6 months and older. - a nasal spray-type swine flu vaccine uses a live, weakened virus instead of a dead one like the flu shot. it is approved for healthy children over 2 years. it should not be used in children who have repeated wheezing episodes, asthma, or other chronic respiratory diseases. what are the side effects of the vaccine? it is not possible to get the flu from either the injection or shot flu vaccine. however, some people do get a low-grade fever for a day or two after the shot. most people have no side effects from the flu shot. some people have soreness at the injection site or minor aches and low-grade fever for several days. normal side effects of the nasal flu vaccine include fever, headache, runny nose, vomiting, and some wheezing. although these symptoms sound like symptoms of the flu, the side effects do not become a severe or life-threatening flu infection. will the vaccine harm my child? a small amount of mercury.  is a common preservative in multidose vaccines. despite concerns, thimerosal-containg vaccines have not been shown to cause autism, adhd, or any other medical problems. if you have concerns about mercury, all of the routine vaccines are also available without added thimerosal. what else can i do to protect my child from the flu? everyone who comes in close contact with your child should follow these tips: - cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. throw the tissue away after using it. - wash hands often with soap and water for 15to 20 seconds, especially after you cough or sneeze. you may also use alcohol-based hand cleaners. - wear a face mask if you have had flu symptoms, or preferably, stay away from children. if your child is less than 5 years old and has close contact with someone with flu symptoms, talk with your provider.)",1,0

2066,what are the genetic changes related to hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets.,"hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can result from mutations in several genes. mutations in the phex gene, which are responsible for x-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, occur most frequently. mutations in other genes cause the less common forms of the condition. hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets is characterized by a phosphate imbalance in the body. among its many functions, phosphate plays a critical role in the formation and growth of bones in childhood and helps maintain bone strength in adults. phosphate levels are controlled in large part by the kidneys. the kidneys normally excrete excess phosphate in urine, and they reabsorb this mineral into the bloodstream when more is need. however, in people with hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets, the kidneys cannot reabsorb phosphate effectively and too much of this mineral is excreted from the body in urine. as a result, not enough phosphate is available in the bloodstream to participate in normal bone development and maintenance. the genes associated with hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets are involved in maintaing the proper balance of phosphate. many of these genes, including the phex gene, directly or indirectly regulate a protein called fibroblast growth factor 23.. this protein normally inhibits the kidneys' ability to reabsorb phosphate into the bloodstream. gene mutations increase the production or reduce the breakdown of fibroblast growth factor 23. the resulting overactivity of this protein reduces phosphate reabsorption by the kidneys, leading to hypophosphatemia and the related features of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets.)",1,2

2279,what is.  gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia.,"gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia is a disorder that affects the bones. people with this condition have reduced bone mineral density. , which causes the bones to be unusually fragile. as a result, affected individuals typically experience multiple bone fractures in childhood, often from mild trauma or with no apparent cause. while most bone tissue is less dense than normal in gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia, the outer layer.  of the shafts of the long bones in the arms and legs is abnormally hard and thick.. bowing of the long bones also occurs in this disorder. jaw problems are common in gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia; the prefix ""gnatho-"" in the condition name refers to the jaw. affected individuals may develop bone infections.  in the jaw, which can lead to pain, swelling, discharge of pus from the gums, loose teeth, and slow healing after teeth are lost or extracted. areas of the jawbone may lose the protective coverage of the gums, which can result in deterioration of the exposed bone.. also, normal bone in areas of the jaw may be replaced by fibrous tissue and a hard material called cementum, which normally surrounds the roots of teeth and anchors them in the jaw. these areas of abnormal bone, called cementoosseous lesions, may be present at birth or develop later in life. when gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia was first described, it was thought to be a variation of another bone disorder called osteogenesis imperfecta, which is also characterized by frequent bone fractures. however, gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia is now generally considered to be a separate condition. unlike in osteogenesis imperfecta, the fractures in gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia heal normally without causing deformity or loss of height.)",2,0
2280,what is.  osteogenesis imperfecta.,"osteogenesis imperfecta.  is a group of genetic disorders that mainly affect the bones. the term ""osteogenesis imperfecta"" means imperfect bone formation. people with this condition have bones that break easily, often from mild trauma or with no apparent cause. multiple fractures are common, and in severe cases, can occur even before birth. milder cases may involve only a few fractures over a person's lifetime. there at least eight recognized forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, designated type i through type vi. the types can be distinguished by their signs and symptoms, although their characteristic features overlap. type is the mildest form of osteogenesis imperfecta and type ii is the most severe; other types of this condition have signs and symptoms that fall somewhere between these two extremes. increasingly, genetic factors are used to define the different forms of osteogenesis imperfecta. the milder forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, including type i, are characterized by bone fractures during childhood and adolescence that often result from minor trauma. fractures occur less frequently in adulthood. people with mild forms of the condition typically have a blue or grey tint to the part of the eye that is usually white. , and may develop hearing loss in adulthood. affected individuals are usually of normal or near normal height. other types of osteogenesis imperfecta are more severe, causing frequent bone fractures that may begin before birth and result from little or no trauma. additional features of these conditions can include blue sclerae, short stature, hearing loss, respiratory problems, and a disorder of tooth development called dentinogenesis imperfecta. the most severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, particularly type ii, can include an abnormally small, fragile rib cage and underdeveloped lungs. infants with these abnormalities have life-threatening problems with breathing and often die shortly after birth.)",2,0
2281,what are the genetic changes related to osteogenesis imperfecta.,"mutations in the col1a1, col1a2, crtap, and p3h1 genes cause osteogenesis imperfecta. mutations in the col1a1 and col1a2 genes are responsible for more than 90 percent of all cases of osteogenesis imperfecta. these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are used to assemble type i collagen. this type of collagen is the most abundant protein bone, skin, and other connective tissues that provide structure and strength to the body. most of the mutations that cause osteogenesis imperfecta type i occur in the col1a1 gene. these genetic changes reduce the amount of type i collagen produced in the body, which causes bones to be brittle and to fracture easily. the mutations responsible for most cases of osteogenesis imperfecta types ii, and iv occur in either the col1a1 or col1a2 gene. these mutations typically alter the structure of type i collagen molecules. a defect in the structure of type i collagen weakens connective tissues, particularly bone, resulting in the characteristic features of osteogenesis imperfecta. mutations in the crtap and p3h1 genes are responsible for rare, often severe cases of osteogenesis imperfecta. cases caused by crtap mutations are usually classified as type vii; when p3h1 mutations underlie the condition, it is classified as type vi. the proteins produced from these genes work together to process collagen into its mature form. mutations in either gene disrupt the normal folding, assembly, and secretion of collagen molecules. these defects weaken connective tissues, leading to severe bone abnormalities and problems with growth. in cases of osteogenesis imperfecta without identified mutations in one of the genes described above, the cause of the disorder is unknown. these cases include osteogenesis imperfecta types v and vi. researchers are working to identify additional genes that may be responsible for these conditions.)",2,0
2282,is osteogenesis imperfecta inherited.,"most cases of osteogenesis imperfecta have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. many people with type i or type iv osteogenesis imperfecta inherit a mutation from a parent who has the disorder. most infants with more severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta.  have no history of the condition in their family. in these infants, the condition is caused by new.  mutations in the col1a1 or col1a2 gene. less commonly, osteogenesis imperfecta has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. autosomal recessive inheritance means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. the parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder typically are not affected, but each carry one copy of the altered gene. some cases of osteogenesis imperfecta type i are autosomal recessive; these cases usually result from mutations in genes other than col1a1 and col1a2. when osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the crtap or p3h1 gene, the condition also has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.)",5,0
2283,what is.  osteogenesis imperfecta.,"osteogenesis imperfecta.  is a genetic disorder in which bones break easily. sometimes the bones break for no known reason. oi can also cause weak muscles, brittle teeth, a curved spine, and hearing loss. oi is caused by one of several genes that aren't working properly. when these genes don't work, it affects how you make collagen, a protein that helps make bones strong. oi can range from mild to severe, and symptoms vary from person to person. a person may have just a few or as many as several hundred fractures in a lifetime. no single test can identify oi. your doctor uses your medical and family history, physical exam, and imaging and lab tests to diagnose it. your doctor may also test your collagen.  or genes.. there is no cure, but you can manage symptoms. treatments include exercise, pain medicine, physical therapy, wheelchairs, braces, and surgery. nih: national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases)",2,0

2341,what causes down syndrome.,"what causes down syndrome? there are 3 possible genetic causes of down syndrome: trisomy 21. most often, down syndrome is caused by an extra chromosome 21 in all cells of the affected person. in these cases, the chromosome 21 pair fails to separate during the formation of an egg. ; this called ""nondisjunction."" when the egg with 2 copies of chromosome 21 unites with a normal sperm with one copy of chromosome 21 to form an embryo, the resulting embryo has 3 copies of chromosome 21 instead of the normal two. the extra chromosome is then copied in every cell of the baby's body, causing the features of down syndrome. the cause of nondisjunction is unknown, but research has shown that it happens more often as women age. nondisjunction is not known to be caused by anything in the environment or anything that parents do.  before or during pregnancy. mosaic trisomy 21. in about 1-2% of cases, only some of the cells in a person's body have an extra chromosome 21; this called ""mosaic trisomy 21. in this situation, the fertilized egg may have the right number of chromosomes, but due to a cell division error early in the development of the embryo, some cells ""acquire"" an extra chromosome 21. a person with mosaic trisomy 21 typically has 46 chromosomes in some cells, and 47 chromosomes.  in others. the features and severity in people with mosaic trisomy 21 may vary widely. translocation trisomy 21. about 3-4% of people with down syndrome have cells that contain 46 chromosomes; however, there is extra chromosome 21 material attached.  onto another chromosome. for parents of a child with down syndrome due to a translocation, there may be an increased chance of down syndrome in future pregnancies. this because one of the two parents may be a carrier of a balanced translocation. however, not all parents of people with translocation trisomy 21 have a translocation. regardless of the type of down syndrome a person has, all people with down syndrome have an extra, critical portion of chromosome 21 present in all or some of their cells. this extra genetic material disrupts the normal course of development, causing the characteristic features of down syndrome.)",2,0

2535,what causes stroke.,"there are two major types of stroke: - ischemic stroke - hemorrhagic stroke ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel that supplies blood to the brain is blocked by a blood clot. this may happen in two ways: - a clot may form in artery that is already very narrow. this called a thrombotic stroke. - a clot may break off from another place in the blood vessels of the brain, or from some other part of the body, and travel up to the brain. this called cerebral embolism, or an embolic stroke. ischemic strokes may also be caused by a sticky substance called plaque that can clog arteries. watch this video about: stroke - secondary to cardiogenic embolism a hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in part of the brain becomes weak and bursts open. this causes blood to leak into the brain. some people have defects in the blood vessels of the brain that make this more likely. these defects may include: - aneurysm - arteriovenous malformation.  hemorrhagic strokes may also occur when someone is taking blood thinners, such as warfarin.. very high blood pressure may cause blood vessels to burst, leading to hemorrhagic stroke. an ischemic stroke can develop bleeding and become a hemorrhagic stroke. high blood pressure is the main risk factor for strokes. other major risk factors are: - irregular heartbeat, called atrial fibrillation - diabetes - family history of stroke - high cholesterol - increasing age, especially after age 55 - ethnicity.  watch this video about: hypertension - overview stroke risk is also higher in: - people who have heart disease or poor blood flow in their legs caused by narrowed arteries - people who have unhealthy lifestyle habits such as smoking, a high-fat diet, and lack of exercise - women who take birth control pills.  - women who are pregnant have an increased risk while pregnant - women who take hormone replacement therapy)",4,0
2536,what are the symptoms of stroke.,"symptoms of stroke depend on which part of the brain is damaged. in some cases, a person may not know that a stroke has occurred. most of the time, symptoms develop suddenly and without warning. but symptoms may occur on and off for the first day or two. symptoms are usually most severe when the stroke first happens, but they may slowly get worse. a headache may occur if the stroke is caused by bleeding in the brain. the headache: - starts suddenly and may be severe - may be worse when you are lying flat - wakes you up from sleep - gets worse when you change positions or when you bend, strain, or cough other symptoms depend on how severe the stroke is, and what part of the brain is affected. symptoms may include: - change in alertness.  - changes in hearing or taste - changes that affect touch and the ability to feel pain, pressure, or different temperatures - confusion or loss of memory - problems swallowing - problems writing or reading - dizziness or abnormal feeling of movement.  - eyesight problems, such as decreased vision, double vision, or total loss of vision - lack of control over the bladder or bowels - loss of balance or coordination, or trouble walking - muscle weakness in the face, arm, or leg.  - numbness or tingling one side of the body - personality, mood, or emotional changes - trouble speaking or understanding others who are speaking)",1,0
2537,what is.  ischemic stroke.,"a stroke is a medical emergency. there are two types - ischemic and hemorrhagic. ischemic stroke is the most common type. it is usually caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. this keeps blood from flowing to the brain. within minutes, brain cells begin to die. another cause is stenosis, or narrowing of the artery. this can happen because of atherosclerosis, a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. transient ischemic attacks.  occur when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted briefly. having a tia can mean you are at risk for having a more serious stroke. symptoms of stroke are - sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg.  - sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech - sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes - sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination - sudden severe headache with no known cause it is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible. blood thinners may be used to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot. post-stroke rehabilitation can help people overcome disabilities caused by stroke damage. nih: national institute of neurological disorders and stroke)",4,0

2630,what is.  aortic stenosis.,"the aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. blood flows out of the heart and into the aorta through the aortic valve. in aortic stenosis, the aortic valve does not open fully. this decreases blood flow from the heart.)",3,1
2631,what causes aortic stenosis.,"as the aortic valve narrows, the left ventricle has to work harder to pump blood out through the valve. to do this extra work, the muscles in the ventricle walls become thicker. this can lead to chest pain. as the pressure continues to rise, blood may back up into the lungs. severe aortic stenosis can limit the amount of blood that reaches the brain and the rest of the body. aortic stenosis may be present from birth. , but most often it develops later in life. children with aortic stenosis may have other conditions present from birth. aortic stenosis mainly occurs due to the buildup of calcium deposits that narrow the valve. this called calcific aortic stenosis. the problem mostly affects older people. calcification of the valve happens sooner in people who are born with abnormal aortic or bicuspid valves. in rare cases, calcification can develop more quickly when a person has received chest radiation.. another cause is rheumatic fever. this condition can develop after strep throat or scarlet fever. valve problems do not develop for 5 - 10 years or longer after rheumatic fever occurs. rheumatic fever is becoming rarer in the united states. aortic stenosis occurs in about 2% of people over 65 years of age. it occurs more often in men than in women.)",1,0

2633,how to diagnose aortic stenosis.,"a heart mur, click, or other abnormal sound is almost always heard through a stethoscope. the health care provider may be able to feel a vibration or movement when placing a hand over the heart. there may be a faint pulse or changes in the quality of the pulse in the neck. blood pressure may be low. aortic stenosis most often detected and then followed using a test called an echocardiogram. the following tests may also be performed: - ecg - exercise stress testing - left cardiac catheterization - mri of the heart - transesophageal echocardiogram.",3,2
2634,what are the treatments for aortic stenosis.,"regular checkups by a health provider may be all that is need if your symptoms are not severe. the health care provider should ask about your health history, do a physical exam, and perform an echocardiogram. people with severe aortic stenosis may be told not to play competive sports, even if they have no symptoms. if symptoms do occur, strenuous activity must often be limited. medicines are used to treat symptoms of heart failure or abnormal heart rhythms.. these include diuretics. , nitrates, and beta-blockers. high blood pressure should also be treated. if aortic stenosis severe, this treatment must be done carefully so blood pressure does not drop too far. in the past, most people with heart valve problems were given antibiotics before dental work or a procedure such as colonoscopy. the antibiotics were given to prevent an infection of the damaged heart. however, antibiotics are now used much less often before dental work and other procedures. check with your health care provider to find out whether you need antibiotics. people with this and other heart conditions should stop smoking and be tested for high cholesterol. surgery to repair or replace the valve is often done for adults or children who develop symptoms. even if symptoms are not very bad, the doctor may recommend surgery based on test results. a less invasive procedure called balloon valvuloplasty may be done instead of surgery. - a balloon is placed into an artery in the groin, threaded to the heart, placed across the valve, and inflated. however, narrowing often occurs again after this procedure. - a newer procedure done at the same time as valvuloplasty can implant an artificial valve. this procedure is most often done in patients who cannot have surgery, but itis becoming more common. some children may need aortic valve repair or replacement. children with mild aortic stenosis may be able to take part in most activities.)",3,2
2635,what is the outlook for aortic stenosis.,"the outcome varies. the disorder may be mild and not produce symptoms. over time, the aortic valve may become narrower. this may result in more severe heart problems such as: - atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter - blood clots to the brain. , intestines, kidneys, or other areas - fainting spells.  - heart failure - high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs.  the results of aortic valve replacement are often excellent. to get the best treatment, go to a center that regularly performs this type of surgery.)",3,0

2675,what is.  adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency.,"adenosine monophosphate.  deaminase deficiency is a condition that can affect the muscles used for movement.. people with this condition do not make enough of an enzyme called amp deaminase. in most people, amp deaminase deficiency does not cause any symptoms. people who do experience symptoms typically have muscle pain.  or weakness after exercise or prolonged physical activity. they often get tired more quickly and stay tired longer than would normally be expected. some affected individuals have more severe symptoms, but is unclear whether these symptoms are due solely to a lack of amp deaminase or additional factors. muscle weakness is typically apparent beginning in childhood or early adulthood. researchers have proposed three types of amp deaminase deficiency, which are distinguished by their symptoms and genetic cause.)",2,0
2676,how many people are affected by adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency.,"amp deaminase deficiency is one of the most common inherited muscle disorders in white populations, affecting 1 in 50 to 100 people. the prevalence is lower in african americans, affecting an estimated 1 in 40,000 people, and the condition is even less common in the japanese population.)",2,0
2677,what are the genetic changes related to adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency.,"mutations in the ampd1 gene cause amp deaminase deficiency. the ampd1 gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called amp deaminase. this enzyme is found in skeletal muscle, where it plays a role in producing energy within muscle cells. mutations in the ampd1 gene disrupt the function of amp deaminase and impair the muscle cells' ability to produce energy. this lack of energy can lead to myalgia or other muscle problems associated with amp deaminase deficiency. the three types of amp deaminase deficiency are known as the inherited type, acquired type, and coincidental inherited type. individuals with the inherited type have a mutation in both copies of the ampd1 gene in each cell. most people are asymptomatic, meaning they have no symptoms. some people with amp deaminase deficiency experience muscle weakness or pain following exercise. the acquired type occurs in people who have decreased levels of amp deaminase due to the presence of a muscle or joint condition. people with the coincidental inherited type have a mutation in both copies of the ampd1 gene. additionally, they have a separate joint or muscle disorder. some individuals experience more severe joint or muscle symptoms related to their disorder if they have amp deaminase deficiency than do people without this enzyme deficiency. most, however, do not have any symptoms associated with amp deaminase deficiency. it is not known why most people with this condition do not experience symptoms. researchers speculate that additional mutations in other genes may be involved.)",2,0
2678,is adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency inherited.,"this condition is inherited in autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.)",5,0
