Question,Answer,Source,,,,,,,,
What is COVID-19,"COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 201",WJLA,,,,,,,,
What are the symptoms of COVID-19,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don°Øt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.",WJLA,,,,,,,,
How does COVID-19 spread,"People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.",WJLA,,,,,,,,
Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air,Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.,WJLA,,,,,,,,
Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms,The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.?,WJLA,,,,,,,,
What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease,Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Maintain at least 3 feet distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.,WJLA,,,,,,,,
Should I wear a mask to protect myself,"People with no respiratory symptoms, such as cough, do not need to wear a medical mask. WHO recommends the use of masks for people who have symptoms of COVID-19 and for those caring for individuals who have symptoms, such as cough and fever.",WJLA,,,,,,,,
"How to put on, use, take off and dispose of a mask","Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes. Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is). Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the colored side). Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it molds to the shape of your nose. Pull down the mask°Øs bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.",WJLA,,,,,,,,

From here you will be advised if a medical assessment is necessary and how to get tested. ",United Nations,,,,,,,,
What alternatives do I have if there are no hand sanitizers available,"If hand sanitizers are not available, hand washing with soap and water is the recommended, and even better, alternative. ",United Nations,,,,,,,,
Can people who recover from COVID-19 be infected again ,"We know that for similar coronaviruses, infected people are unlikely to be re-infected shortly after they recover. However, because the immune response to COVID-19 is not yet understood, it is not yet known whether similar immune protection will be observed for patients who have recovered from COVID-19. ",United Nations,,,,,,,,
Is it safe to receive a package from an area where COVID-19 has been reported ,"Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low. ",United Nations,,,,,,,,
Is there a connection between COVID -19 and environment temperature ,"It is not known yet if weather and temperature changes impact or has any connection with COVID-19.
