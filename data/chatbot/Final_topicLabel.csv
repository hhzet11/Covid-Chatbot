What is COVID-19,"COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 201",0,8
What are the symptoms of COVID-19,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.",1,3
How does COVID-19 spread,"People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.",2,3
Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air,Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.,3,9
Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms,The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.?,4,3

What causes Polycystic ovary syndrome ? (Also called: Polycystic ovaries; Polycystic ovary disease; Stein-Leventhal syndrome; Polyfollicular ovarian disease),"PCOS is linked to changes in hormone levels that make it harder for the ovaries to release fully-grown (mature) eggs. The reasons for these changes are unclear. The hormones affected are:  - Estrogen and progesterone, the female hormones that help a woman's ovaries release eggs   - Androgen, a male hormone that is found in small amounts in women   Normally, one or more eggs are released during a woman's cycle. This is known as ovulation. In most cases, this release of eggs occurs about 2 weeks after the start of a menstrual period.   In PCOS, mature eggs are not released. Instead, they stay in the ovaries with a small amount of fluid around them. There can be many of these. However, not all women with the condition will have ovaries with this appearance.   These problems with the release of eggs can contribute to infertility. The other symptoms of this disorder are due to thehormoneimbalances.  Most of the time, PCOS is diagnosed in women in their 20s or 30s. However, it may also affect teenage girls. The symptoms often begin when a girl's periods start. Women with this disorder often have a mother or sister who has similar symptoms.) ",487,0

What is (are) polycystic kidney disease ? (Also called: PKD; polycystic renal disease),"Polycystic kidney disease is a disorder that affects the kidneys and other organs. Clusters of fluid-filled sacs, called cysts, develop in the kidneys and interfere with their ability to filter waste products from the blood. The growth of cysts causes the kidneys to become enlarged and can lead to kidney failure. Cysts may also develop in other organs, particularly the liver.  Frequent complications of polycystic kidney disease include dangerously high blood pressure (hypertension), pain in the back or sides, blood in the urine (hematuria), recurrent urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and heart valve abnormalities. Additionally, people with polycystic kidney disease have an increased risk of an abnormal bulging (an aneurysm) in a large blood vessel called the aorta or in blood vessels at the base of the brain. Aneurysms can be life-threatening if they tear or rupture.  The two major forms of polycystic kidney disease are distinguished by the usual age of onset and the pattern in which it is passed through families. The autosomal dominant form (sometimes called ADPKD) has signs and symptoms that typically begin in adulthood, although cysts in the kidney are often present from birth or childhood. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease can be further divided into type 1 and type 2, depending on the genetic cause. The autosomal recessive form of polycystic kidney disease (sometimes called ARPKD) is much rarer and is often lethal early in life. The signs and symptoms of this condition are usually apparent at birth or in early infancy.) ",501,0
What are the genetic changes related to polycystic kidney disease ? (Also called: PKD; polycystic renal disease),"Mutations in the PKD1, PKD2, and PKHD1 genes cause polycystic kidney disease.  Mutations in either the PKD1 or PKD2 gene can cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; PKD1 gene mutations cause ADPKD type 1, and PKD2 gene mutations cause ADPKD type 2. These genes provide instructions for making proteins whose functions are not fully understood. Researchers believe that they are involved in transmitting chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. The two proteins work together to promote normal kidney development, organization, and function. Mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 gene lead to the formation of thousands of cysts, which disrupt the normal functions of the kidneys and other organs. People with mutations in the PKD2 gene, particularly women, typically have a less severe form of the disease than people with PKD1 mutations. The signs and symptoms, including a decline in kidney function, tend to appear later in adulthood in people with a PKD2 mutation.  Mutations in the PKHD1 gene cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. This gene provides instructions for making a protein whose exact function is unknown; however, the protein likely transmits chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell nucleus. Researchers have not determined how mutations in the PKHD1 gene lead to the formation of numerous cysts characteristic of polycystic kidney disease.  Although polycystic kidney disease is usually a genetic disorder, a small percentage of cases are not caused by gene mutations. These cases are called acquired polycystic kidney disease. This form of the disorder occurs most often in people with other types of kidney disease who have been treated for several years with hemodialysis (a procedure that filters waste products from the blood).) ",502,7
Is polycystic kidney disease inherited ? (Also called: PKD; polycystic renal disease),"Most cases of polycystic kidney disease have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. People with this condition are born with one mutated copy of the PKD1 or PKD2 gene in each cell. In about 90 percent of these cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. The other 10 percent of cases result from a new mutation in one of the genes and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.  Although one altered copy of a gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder, an additional mutation in the second copy of the PKD1 or PKD2 gene may make cysts grow faster and increase the severity of the disease. The rate at which cysts enlarge and cause a loss of kidney function varies widely, and may be influenced by mutations in other genes that have not been identified.  Polycystic kidney disease also can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. People with this form of the condition have two altered copies of the PKHD1 gene in each cell. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are not affected but are carriers of one copy of the altered gene.) ",503,7
What is (are) Celiac disease - nutritional considerations ? (Also called: Gluten-free diet; Gluten sensitive enteropathy - diet; Celiac sprue - diet),"Celiac disease is an immune disorder passed down through families.  Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, or sometimes oats. It may also be found in some medicines.

Therefore, a person becomes malnourished, no matter how much food he or she eats.  The disease can develop at any point in life, from infancy to late adulthood.  People who have a family member with celiac disease are at greater risk for developing the disease. The disorder is most common in Caucasians and persons of European ancestry.

What is (are) celiac disease ? (Also called: celiac sprue; gluten enteropathy; sprue),"Celiac disease is a condition in which the immune system is abnormally sensitive to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder; autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Without a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet, inflammation resulting from immune system overactivity may cause a wide variety of signs and symptoms involving many parts of the body.  Celiac disease can develop at any age after an individual starts eating foods containing gluten. The classic symptoms of the condition result from inflammation affecting the gastrointestinal tract. This inflammation damages the villi, which are small, finger-like projections that line the small intestine and provide a greatly increased surface area to absorb nutrients. In celiac disease, the villi become shortened and eventually flatten out. Intestinal damage causes diarrhea and poor absorption of nutrients, which may lead to weight loss. Abdominal pain, swelling (distention), and food intolerances are common in celiac disease. Inflammation associated with celiac disease may lead to an increased risk of developing certain gastrointestinal cancers such as cancers of the small intestine or esophagus.  Inflammation and poor nutrient absorption may lead to problems affecting many other organs and systems of the body in affected individuals. These health problems may include iron deficiency that results in a low number of red blood cells (anemia), vitamin deficiencies, low bone mineral density (osteoporosis), itchy skin rashes (dermatitis herpetiformis), defects in the enamel of the teeth, chronic fatigue, joint pain, poor growth, delayed puberty, infertility, or repeated miscarriages. Neurological problems have also been associated with celiac disease; these include migraine headaches, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). Many people with celiac disease have one or more of these varied health problems but do not have gastrointestinal symptoms. This form of the condition is called nonclassic celiac disease. Researchers now believe that nonclassic celiac disease is actually more common than the classic form.  Celiac disease often goes undiagnosed because many of its signs and symptoms are nonspecific, which means they may occur in many disorders. Most people who have one or more of these nonspecific health problems do not have celiac disease. On average, a diagnosis of celiac disease is not made until 6 to 10 years after symptoms begin.  Some people have silent celiac disease, in which they have no symptoms of the disorder. However, people with silent celiac disease do have immune proteins in their blood (antibodies) that are common in celiac disease. They also have inflammatory damage to their small intestine that can be detected with a biopsy.  In a small number of cases, celiac disease does not improve with a gluten-free diet and progresses to a condition called refractory sprue. Refractory sprue is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption of nutrients, and an increased risk of developing a type of cancer of the immune cells called T-cell lymphoma.) ",512,3
How many people are affected by celiac disease ? (Also called: celiac sprue; gluten enteropathy; sprue),Celiac disease is a common disorder. Its prevalence has been estimated at about 1 in 100 people worldwide.) ,513,3
What are the genetic changes related to celiac disease ? (Also called: celiac sprue; gluten enteropathy; sprue),"The risk of developing celiac disease is increased by certain variants of the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that play a critical role in the immune system. The HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.  The proteins produced from the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes attach (bind) to each other to form a functional protein complex called an antigen-binding DQ heterodimer. This complex, which is present on the surface of certain immune system cells, attaches to protein fragments (peptides) outside the cell. If the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign (such as viral or bacterial peptides), it triggers a response to attack the invading viruses or bacteria.  Celiac disease is associated with an inappropriate immune response to a segment of the gluten protein called gliadin. This inappropriate activation of the immune system causes inflammation that damages the body's organs and tissues and leads to the signs and symptoms of celiac disease.  Almost all people with celiac disease have specific variants of the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes, which seem to increase the risk of an inappropriate immune response to gliadin. However, these variants are also found in 30 percent of the general population, and only 3 percent of individuals with the gene variants develop celiac disease.  It appears likely that other contributors, such as environmental factors and changes in other genes, also influence the development of this complex disorder.) ",514,5
Is celiac disease inherited ? (Also called: celiac sprue; gluten enteropathy; sprue),"Celiac disease tends to cluster in families.

What is (are) myasthenia gravis ? (Also called: MG),"Myasthenia gravis is a disorder that causes weakness of the skeletal muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. The weakness most often starts in the muscles around the eyes, causing drooping of the eyelids (ptosis) and difficulty coordinating eye movements, which results in blurred or double vision. In a form of the disorder called ocular myasthenia, the weakness remains confined to the eye muscles. In most people with myasthenia gravis, however, additional muscles in the face and neck are affected. Affected individuals may have unusual facial expressions, difficulty holding up the head, speech impairment (dysarthria), and chewing and swallowing problems (dysphagia) that may lead to choking, gagging, or drooling.  Other muscles in the body are also affected in some people with myasthenia gravis. The muscles of the arms and legs may be involved, causing affected individuals to have changes in their gait or trouble with lifting objects, rising from a seated position, or climbing stairs. The muscle weakness tends to fluctuate over time; it typically worsens with activity and improves with rest.  Weakness of the muscles in the chest wall and the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm) can cause breathing problems in some people with myasthenia gravis. About 10 percent of people with this disorder experience a potentially life-threatening complication in which these respiratory muscles weaken to the point that breathing is dangerously impaired, and the affected individual requires ventilation assistance. This respiratory failure, called a myasthenic crisis, may be triggered by stresses such as infections or reactions to medications.  People can develop myasthenia gravis at any age. For reasons that are unknown, it is most commonly diagnosed in women younger than age 40 and men older than age 60. It is uncommon in children, but some infants born to women with myasthenia gravis show signs and symptoms of the disorder for the first few days or weeks of life. This temporary occurrence of symptoms is called transient neonatal myasthenia gravis.) ",517,6

What is (are) Celiac disease - nutritional considerations ? (Also called: Gluten-free diet; Gluten sensitive enteropathy - diet; Celiac sprue - diet),"Celiac disease is an immune disorder passed down through families.  Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, or sometimes oats. It may also be found in some medicines. When a person with celiac disease eats or drinks anything containing gluten, the immune system responds by damaging the lining of the intestinal tract.

The damage to the lining of the intestine comes from a reaction to eating gluten, which is found in wheat, rye, barley,and possibly oats, and in food made from these ingredients.) ",529,3
What causes Celiac disease - sprue ? (Also called: Sprue; Nontropical sprue; Gluten intolerance; Gluten-sensitive enteropathy),"The exact cause of celiac disease is unknown. The lining of the intestines have small projections contains areas called villi. These structures help absorb nutrients. When people with celiac disease eat foods or use products that contain gluten, their immune system reacts by damaging the villi. As a result, the villi are unable absorb nutrients properly. Therefore, a person becomes malnourished, no matter how much food he or she eats.  The disease can develop at any point in life, from infancy to late adulthood.  People who have a family member with celiac disease are at greater risk for developing the disease. The disorder is most common in Caucasians and persons of European ancestry. Women are affected more often than men.  People with celiac disease are more likely to have:  - Autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Sjogren syndrome  - Addison's disease  - Down syndrome  - Intestinal cancer  - Intestinal lymphoma  - Lactose intolerance  - Thyroid disease  - Type 1 diabetes) ",530,4

(Also called: r(20) syndrome; ring 20 syndrome; ring chromosome 20; ring chromosome 20 epilepsy syndrome),"Ring chromosome 20 syndrome is a condition that affects the normal development and function of the brain. The most common feature of this condition is recurrent seizures (epilepsy) in childhood. The seizures may occur during the day or at night during sleep. They are described as partial seizures because they affect only one area of the brain, a region called the frontal lobe. In many cases, the seizures are complex and resistant to treatment with anti-epileptic drugs. Prolonged seizure episodes known as non-convulsive status epilepticus also appear to be characteristic of ring chromosome 20 syndrome. These episodes involve confusion and behavioral changes.  Most people with ring chromosome 20 syndrome also have some degree of intellectual disability and behavioral difficulties. Although these problems can appear either before or after the onset of epilepsy, they tend to worsen after seizures develop. Additional features of this condition can include slow growth and short stature, a small head (microcephaly), and subtle differences in facial features. Major birth defects are rarely seen with ring chromosome 20 syndrome.) ",536,10

What are the genetic changes related to ring chromosome 20 syndrome ? (Also called: r(20) syndrome; ring 20 syndrome; ring chromosome 20; ring chromosome 20 epilepsy syndrome),"Ring chromosome 20 syndrome is caused by a chromosomal abnormality known as a ring chromosome 20 or r(20). A ring chromosome is a circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and its broken ends fuse together. People with ring chromosome 20 syndrome have one copy of this abnormal chromosome in some or all of their cells.  It is not well understood how the ring chromosome causes the signs and symptoms of this syndrome. In some affected individuals, genes near the ends of chromosome 20 are deleted when the ring chromosome forms. Researchers suspect that the loss of these genes may be responsible for epilepsy and other health problems. However, other affected individuals do not have gene deletions associated with the ring chromosome. In these people, the ring chromosome may change the activity of certain genes on chromosome 20, or it may be unable to copy (replicate) itself normally during cell division. Researchers are still working to determine the precise relationship between the ring chromosome 20 and the characteristic features of the syndrome.) ",538,10

Your body needs some sodium to work properly. It helps with the function of nerves and muscles. It also helps to keep the right balance of fluids in your body. Your kidneys control how much sodium is in your body. If you have too much and your kidneys can't get rid it, sodium builds up in your blood. This can lead to high blood pressure. High blood pressure can lead to other health problems.    Most people in the U.S. get more sodium in their diets than they need. A key to healthy eating is choosing foods low in salt and sodium. Doctors recommend you eat less than 2.4 grams per day. That equals about 1 teaspoon of table salt a day. Reading food labels can help you see how much sodium is in prepared foods.

What is Phosphate salts ?,"Phosphate salts refers to many different combinations of the chemical phosphate with salts and minerals. Foods high in phosphate include dairy products, whole grain cereals, nuts, and certain meats. Phosphates found in dairy products and meats seem to be more easily absorbed by the body than phosphates found in cereal grains. Cola drinks contain a lot of phosphate - so much, in fact, that they can cause too much phosphate in the blood.     People use phosphate salts for medicine. Be careful not to confuse phosphate salts with substances such as organophosphates, or with tribasic sodium phosphates and tribasic potassium phosphates, which are very poisonous.     Phosphate salts are taken by mouth for treating blood phosphate levels that are too low and blood calcium levels that are too high, and for preventing kidney stones. They are also taken for treating osteomalacia (often called rickets in children), a condition caused by a mineral imbalance in the body that leads to softening of the bones. Phosphate salts are also used for improving exercise performance, as an antacid for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and as a laxative for emptying the bowels before surgery.     Phosphate salts and calcium are applied to sensitive teeth to reduce pain.     Rectally, phosphate salts are used as a laxative to clean the bowels before surgery or intestinal tests.     Healthcare providers sometimes give potassium phosphate intravenously (by IV) for treating low phosphate and high calcium levels in the blood, and for preventing low phosphate in patients who are being tube-fed.)

How effective is Phosphate salts ?,"Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.  The effectiveness ratings for PHOSPHATE SALTS are as follows: Effective for...  - Preparing the bowel for a medical procedure. Sodium phosphate tablets (OsmoPrep, Visicol, Salix Pharmaceuticals, Raleigh, NC) are FDA-approved for cleansing the colon before a colonoscopy. Over-the-counter sodium phosphate solutions and enemas may also be used for bowel cleansing before medical procedures.   - Low phosphate levels in the blood. Taking sodium or potassium phosphate by mouth is effective for preventing or treating low phosphate levels in the blood. Intravenous phosphate salts may also treat low phosphate levels in the blood when used under the supervision of a physician.  Likely effective for...  - Constipation. Sodium phosphate is an FDA-permitted over-the-counter (OTC) ingredient for the treatment of constipation. These products are taken by mouth or used as enemas.   - Indigestion. Aluminum phosphate and calcium phosphate are FDA-permitted ingredients used in antacids.   - High calcium levels in the blood. Taking phosphate salt (except calcium phosphate) by mouth is likely effective for treating high levels of calcium in the blood. But intravenous phosphate salts should not be used.   Possibly effective for...  - Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Taking potassium phosphate by mouth might help prevent calcium kidney stones from forming in patients with high urine levels of calcium.  Possibly ineffective for...  - Athletic performance. Some early research suggests that taking sodium phosphate by mouth four times daily for 6 days might increase athletic performance in male cyclists. However, most evidence shows that taking phosphate salts by mouth does not improve exercise performance.  Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...  - Diabetes complication (diabetic ketoacidosis). Early research suggests that taking potassium phosphate intravenously (by IV) does not improve a diabetes complication in which the body produces too many blood acids called ketones. People with this condition should only be given phosphates if they have low phosphate levels.   - Complications that occur upon eating in people who were previously starving (refeeding syndrome). Limited research shows that giving sodium and potassium phosphates intravenously (by IV) over 24 hours prevents refeeding syndrome when restarting nutrition in people who are severely malnourished or starved.    - Sensitive teeth.   - Other conditions.  More evidence is needed to rate phosphate salts for these uses.) ",544,7

What causes Benign positional vertigo ? (Also called: Vertigo - positional; Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; BPPV: dizziness- positional),"Benign positional vertigo is also called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). It is caused by a problem in the inner ear.   The inner ear has fluid-filled tubes called semicircular canals. When you move, the fluid moves inside these tubes. The canals are very sensitive to any movement of the fluid. The sensation of the fluid moving in the tube tells your brain the position of your body. This helps you keep your balance.  BPPV occurs when a small piece of bone-like calcium breaks free and floats inside the tube. This sends confusing messages to your brain about your body's position.  BPPV has no major risk factors. But, your risk for developing BPPV may increase if you have:  - Family members with BPPV  - Had a prior head injury (even a slight bump to the head)  - Had an inner ear infection called labyrinthitis) ",554,2

This bacterium causes infection when it gets into broken skin or mucus membranes, usually of the genitals. Syphilis is most often transmitted through sexual contact, although it also can be transmitted in other ways.  Syphilis occurs worldwide, most commonly in urban areas. The number of cases is rising fastest in men who have sex with men. Young adults ages 15 to 25 are the highest-risk population. People have no natural resistance to syphilis.  Because people may be unaware that they are infected with syphilis, many states require tests for syphilis before marriage. All pregnant women who receive prenatal care should be screened for syphilis to prevent the infection from passing to their newborn (congenital syphilis).  Syphilis has three stages:  - Primary syphilis  - Secondary syphilis  - Tertiary syphilis (the late phase of the illness)    Secondary syphilis, tertiary syphilis, and congenital syphilis are not seen as often in the United States as they were in the past because of the availability of:  - Free, government-sponsored sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics  - Screening tests for syphilis  - Public education about STIs  - Prenatal screening) ",568,2
What are the symptoms of Syphilis - primary ? (Also called: Primary syphilis; Secondary syphilis; Late syphilis; Tertiary syphilis),"Symptoms of primary syphilis are:  - Small, painless open sore or ulcer (called a chancre) on the genitals, mouth, skin, or rectum that heals by itself in 3to 6 weeks  - Enlarged lymph nodes in the area of the sore    The bacteria continue to grow in the body, but there are few symptoms until the second stage.  Secondary syphilis symptoms may include:  - Skin rash, usually on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet  - Sores called mucous patches in or around the mouth, vagina, or penis  - Moist, warty patches (called condylomata lata) in the genitals or skin folds  - Fever  - General ill feeling  - Loss of appetite  - Muscle aches  - Joint pain  - Swollen lymph nodes  - Vision changes  - Hair loss    Symptoms of tertiary syphilis depend on which organs have been affected. They vary widely and can be difficult to diagnose. Symptoms include:  - Damage to the heart, causing aneurysms or valve disease  - Central nervous system disorders (neurosyphilis)  - Tumors of skin, bones, or liver) ",569,3
Do I need to see a doctor for Syphilis - primary ? (Also called: Primary syphilis; Secondary syphilis; Late syphilis; Tertiary syphilis),"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of syphilis.  Contact your doctor or nurse, or get screened in an STI clinic if you have:   - Had intimate contact with a person who has syphilis or any other STI  - Engaged in any high-risk sexual practices, including having multiple or unknown partners or using intravenous drugs) ",570,6
What is (are) Syphilis ?,"Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by bacteria. It infects the genital area, lips, mouth, or anus of both men and women. You usually get syphilis from sexual contact with someone who has it. It can also pass from mother to baby during pregnancy.    The early stage of syphilis usually causes a single, small, painless sore. Sometimes it causes swelling in nearby lymph nodes. If you do not treat it, syphilis usually causes a non-itchy skin rash, often on your hands and feet. Many people do not notice symptoms for years. Symptoms can go away and come back.    The sores caused by syphilis make it easier to get or give someone HIV during sex. If you are pregnant, syphilis can cause birth defects, or you could lose your baby. In rare cases, syphilis causes serious health problems and even death.    Syphilis is easy to cure with antibiotics if you catch it early. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading syphilis.    NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) ",571,2
How to diagnose Syphilis - primary ? (Also called: Primary syphilis; Secondary syphilis; Late syphilis; Tertiary syphilis),"The doctor or nurse will examine you. Tests that may be done include:  - Examination of fluid from sore  - Echocardiogram, aortic angiogram, and cardiac catheterization to look at the major blood vessels and the heart  - Spinal tap and examination of spinal fluid  - Blood tests to screen for syphillis bacteria (RPR, VDRL, or TRUST)    If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis:   - FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test)  - MHA-TP  - TP-EIA  - TP-PA) ",572,9
What are the treatments for Syphilis - primary ? (Also called: Primary syphilis; Secondary syphilis; Late syphilis; Tertiary syphilis),"Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as:   - Doxycycline  - Penicillin G benzathine  - Tetracycline (for patients who are allergic to penicillin)    Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the patient's overall health.  To treat syphilis during pregnancy, penicillin is the drug of choice. Tetracycline cannot be used for treatment because it is dangerous to the unborn baby. Erythromycin may not prevent congenital syphilis in the baby. People who are allergic to penicillin should ideally be desensitized to it, and then treated with penicillin.  Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection.  Symptoms and signs of this reaction include:  - Chills  - Fever  - General ill feeling (malaise)  - Headache  - Joint aches  - Muscle aches  - Nausea  - Rash    These symptoms usually disappear within 24 hours.  Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection.  All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis is extremely contagious in the primary and secondary stages.) ",573,2

What is (are) Prediabetes ? (Also called: Impaired fasting glucose - prediabetes; Impaired glucose tolerance - prediabetes),"Prediabetes occurs when the level of sugar (glucose) in your blood is too high, but not high enough to be called diabetes.   If you have prediabetes, you are at a much higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes within 10 years. It also greatly increases your risk for heart disease.   Losing extra weight and getting regular exercise CAN stop prediabetes from becoming full-blown diabetes.) ",581,5
What is (are) Prediabetes ? (Also called: Impaired fasting glucose - prediabetes; Impaired glucose tolerance - prediabetes),"Your body gets energy from the glucose in your blood. A hormone called insulin helps the cells in your body use glucose. If you have prediabetes, this process does not work as well. Glucose builds up in your bloodstream. If the levels get high enough, you can develop type 2 diabetes.  Having diabetes increases the risk for certain health problems. This is because high glucose levels in the blood can damage the blood vessels and nerves. This can lead to heart disease and stroke. If you have prediabetes, damage may already be occurring in your blood vessels.   Having prediabetes is a wake-up call to take action to improve your health.) ",582,5
How to prevent Prediabetes ? (Also called: Impaired fasting glucose - prediabetes; Impaired glucose tolerance - prediabetes),"Your health care provider will talk with you about your condition and your risks from prediabetes. To help you prevent diabetes, your provider will likely suggest certain lifestyle changes:  Eat healthy foods: This includes whole grains, lean proteins, low-fat dairy, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Watch portion sizes, and avoid sweets and fried foods.   Lose weight: Just a small weight loss can make a big difference in your health. For example, your provider may suggest that you lose about 7% of your body weight. So, if you weigh 200 pounds, your goal would be to lose about 14 pounds. Your provider may suggest a diet or you can join a program to help you lose weight.  Get more exercise: Aim to get at least 30 to 60 minutes of moderate exercise at least 5 days a week. This can include brisk walking, riding your bike, or swimming. You can also break up exercise into smaller sessions throughout the day.  Take medicines as directed: Depending on your other risk factors, your provider may prescribe medicines to lower cholesterol or blood pressure or to help prevent diabetes.) ",583,5
What is (are) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency ? (Also called: Deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; G6PD Deficiency; G6PDD; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency),"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is a genetic disorder that occurs most often in males. This condition mainly affects red blood cells, which carry oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body. In affected individuals, a defect in an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase causes red blood cells to break down prematurely. This destruction of red blood cells is called hemolysis.  The most common medical problem associated with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is hemolytic anemia, which occurs when red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. This type of anemia leads to paleness, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), dark urine, fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate. In people with glucose-6-dehydrogenase deficiency, hemolytic anemia is most often triggered by bacterial or viral infections or by certain drugs (such as some antibiotics and medications used to treat malaria). Hemolytic anemia can also occur after eating fava beans or inhaling pollen from fava plants (a reaction called favism).  Glucose-6-dehydrogenase deficiency is also a significant cause of mild to severe jaundice in newborns. Many people with this disorder, however, never experience any signs or symptoms.) ",584,3
Do you have information about Blood Sugar (Also called: Blood glucose),"Blood sugar, or glucose, is the main sugar found in your blood. It comes from the food you eat, and is your body's main source of energy. Your blood carries glucose to all of your body's cells to use for energy.    Diabetes is a disease in which your blood sugar levels are too high. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. Even if you don't have diabetes, sometimes you may have problems with blood sugar that is too low or too high. Keeping a regular schedule of eating, activity, and taking any medicines you need can help.    If you do have diabetes, it is very important to keep your blood sugar numbers in your target range. You may need to check your blood sugar several times each day. Your health care provider will also do a blood test called an A1C. It checks your average blood sugar level over the past three months. If your blood sugar is too high, you may need to take medicines and/or follow a special diet.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) ",585,5

How should Glucagon be used and what is the dosage ?,"Glucagon is usually given by injection beneath the skin, in the muscle, or in the vein. It comes as a powder and liquid that will need to be mixed just before administering the dose. Instructions for mixing and giving the injection are in the package. Glucagon should be administered as soon as possible after discovering that the patient is unconscious from low blood sugar. After the injection, the patient should be turned onto the side to prevent choking if they vomit. Once the glucagon has been given, contact your doctor. It is very important that all patients have a household member who knows the symptoms of low blood sugar and how to administer glucagon.  If you have low blood sugar often, keep a glucagon kit with you at all times. You should be able to recognize some of the signs and symptoms of low blood sugar (i.e., shakiness, dizziness or lightheadedness, sweating, confusion, nervousness or irritability, sudden changes in behavior or mood, headache, numbness or tingling around the mouth, weakness, pale skin, sudden hunger, clumsy or jerky movements). Try to eat or drink a food or beverage with sugar in it, such as hard candy or fruit juice, before it is necessary to administer glucagon.  Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your pharmacist or doctor to explain any part you or your household members do not understand. Use glucagon exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.) ",593,4
Do you have information about Communicating with patients,"Patient education allows patients to play a bigger role in their own care. It also aligns with the growing movement toward patient- and family-centered care.  To be effective, patient education needs to be more than instructions and information. Teachers and health care providers need to be able to assess patient needs and communicate clearly.  The success of patient education depends largely on how well you assess your patient's:  - Needs  - Concerns  - Readiness to learn  - Preferences  - Support  - Barriers and limitations (such as physical and mental capacity, and low health literacy)    Often, the first step is to find out what the patient already knows. Use these guidelines to do a thorough assessment before starting patient education:  - Gather clues. Talk to the health care team members and observe the patient. Be careful not to make assumptions. Patient teaching based on incorrect assumptions may not be very effective and may take more time.  - Get to know your patient. Introduce yourself and explain your role in your patient's care. Review their medical record and ask basic get-to-know-you questions.  - Establish a rapport. Make eye contact when appropriate and help your patient feel comfortable with you. Pay attention to the person's concerns.  - Gain trust. Show respect and treat each person with compassion and without judgment.  - Determine your patient's readiness to learn. Ask your patients about their outlooks, attitudes, and motivations.  - Learn the patient's perspective. Talk to the patient about worries, fears, and possible misconceptions. The information you receive can help guide your patient teaching.  - Ask the right questions. Ask if the patient has concerns, not just questions. Use open-ended questions that require the patient to reveal more details. Listen carefully. The patient's answers will help you learn the person's core beliefs. This will help you understand the patient's motivation and let you plan the best ways to teach.  - Learn about the patient's skills. Find out what your patient already knows. You may want to use the teach-back method (also called the show-me method or closing the loop) to figure out what the patient may have learned from other health care providers. The teach-back method is a way to confirm that you have explained the information in a way that the patient they understands. Also, find out what skills the patient may still need to develop.  - Involve others. Ask if the patient wants other people involved with the care process. It is possible that the person who volunteers to be involved in your patient's care may not be the person your patient prefers to be involved. Learn about the support available to your patient.  - Identify barriers and limitations. You may perceive barriers to education, and the patient may confirm them. Some factors, such as low health literacy may be more subtle and harder to recognize.  - Take time to establish rapport. Do a comprehensive assessment. It is worth it, because your patient education efforts will be more effective.) ",594,4

What is (are) Hip joint replacement ? (Also called: Hip arthroplasty; Total hip replacement; Hip hemiarthroplasty),"Your hip joint is made up of two major parts. One or both parts may be replaced during surgery:  -  The hip socket (a part of the pelvic bone called the acetabulum)   -  The upper end of the thighbone (called the femoral head)    The new hip that replaces the old one is made up of these parts:  - A socket, which is usually made of strong metal.  - A liner, which fits inside the socket. It is usually plastic, but some surgeons are now trying other materials, like ceramic. The liner allows the hip to move smoothly.  - A metal or ceramic ball that will replace the round head (top) of your thigh bone.  - A metal stem that is attached to the thigh bone to make the joint more stable.    You will not feel any pain during surgery. You will have one of two types of anesthesia:  - General anesthesia. This means you will be asleep and unable to feel pain.   -  Regional (spinal or epidural anesthesia). Medicine is put into your back to make you numb below your waist. You will also get medicine to make you sleepy. And you may get medicine that will make you forget about the procedure, even though you will not be fully asleep.    After you receive anesthesia, your surgeon will make a surgical cut to open up your hip joint. Often this cut is over the buttocks. Then your surgeon will:  - Cut and remove the head of your thigh bone  - Clean out your hip socket and remove the rest of the cartilage and damaged or arthritic bone  - Put the new hip socket in place, then insert the metal stem into your thigh bone  - Place the correct-sized ball for the new joint  - Secure all of the new parts in place, sometimes with a special cement  - Repair the muscles and tendons around the new joint  - Close the surgical wound    This surgery takes about 1 - 3 hours.)

Do you have information about Hip Replacement (Also called: Hip arthroplasty; Hip prosthesis),"Hip replacement is surgery for people with severe hip damage. The most common cause of damage is osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis causes pain, swelling, and reduced motion in your joints. It can interfere with your daily activities. If other treatments such as physical therapy, pain medicines, and exercise haven't helped, hip replacement surgery might be an option for you.    During a hip replacement operation, the surgeon removes damaged cartilage and bone from your hip joint and replaces them with new, man-made parts.    A hip replacement can       - Relieve pain    - Help your hip joint work better    - Improve walking and other movements       The most common problem after surgery is hip dislocation. Because a man-made hip is smaller than the original joint, the ball can come out of its socket. The surgery can also cause blood clots and infections. With a hip replacement, you might need to avoid certain activities, such as jogging and high-impact sports.    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases) ",609,4

What is (are) lactose intolerance ? (Also called: alactasia; dairy product intolerance; hypolactasia; lactose malabsorption; milk sugar intolerance),"Lactose intolerance is an impaired ability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. Lactose is normally broken down by an enzyme called lactase, which is produced by cells in the lining of the small intestine.  Congenital lactase deficiency, also called congenital alactasia, is a disorder in which infants are unable to break down lactose in breast milk or formula. This form of lactose intolerance results in severe diarrhea. If affected infants are not given a lactose-free infant formula, they may develop severe dehydration and weight loss.  Lactose intolerance in adulthood is caused by reduced production of lactase after infancy (lactase nonpersistence). If individuals with lactose intolerance consume lactose-containing dairy products, they may experience abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, nausea, and diarrhea beginning 30 minutes to 2 hours later.  Most people with lactase nonpersistence retain some lactase activity and can include varying amounts of lactose in their diets without experiencing symptoms. Often, affected individuals have difficulty digesting fresh milk but can eat certain dairy products such as cheese or yogurt without discomfort. These foods are made using fermentation processes that break down much of the lactose in milk.) ",668,5
What are the genetic changes related to lactose intolerance ? (Also called: alactasia; dairy product intolerance; hypolactasia; lactose malabsorption; milk sugar intolerance),"Lactose intolerance in infants (congenital lactase deficiency) is caused by mutations in the LCT gene. The LCT gene provides instructions for making the lactase enzyme. Mutations that cause congenital lactase deficiency are believed to interfere with the function of lactase, causing affected infants to have a severely impaired ability to digest lactose in breast milk or formula.  Lactose intolerance in adulthood is caused by gradually decreasing activity (expression) of the LCT gene after infancy, which occurs in most humans. LCT gene expression is controlled by a DNA sequence called a regulatory element, which is located within a nearby gene called MCM6. Some individuals have inherited changes in this element that lead to sustained lactase production in the small intestine and the ability to digest lactose throughout life. People without these changes have a reduced ability to digest lactose as they get older, resulting in the signs and symptoms of lactose intolerance.) ",669,5
Who should get Penicillin G Benzathine and Penicillin G Procaine Injection and why is it prescribed ?,"Penicillin G benzathine and penicillin G procaine injection is used to treat and prevent certain infections caused by bacteria. Penicillin G benzathine and penicillin G procaine injection should not be used to treat sexually transmitted diseases (STD) or early in the treatment of certain serious infections. Penicillin G benzathine and penicillin G procaine injection is in a class of medications called penicillins. It works by killing bacteria that cause infections.  Antibiotics such as penicillin G benzathine and penicillin G procaine injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.) ",670,2
What is (are) Lactose Intolerance ? (Also called: Dairy product intolerance; Lactase deficiency; Milk intolerance),"Lactose intolerance means that you cannot digest foods with lactose in them. Lactose is the sugar found in milk and foods made with milk. After eating foods with lactose in them, you may feel sick to your stomach. You may also have       -  Gas     -  Diarrhea     -  Swelling in your stomach        Your doctor may do a blood, breath or stool test to find out if your problems are due to lactose intolerance.    Lactose intolerance is not serious. Eating less food with lactose, or using pills or drops to help you digest lactose usually helps. You may need to take a calcium supplement if you don't get enough of it from your diet, since milk and foods made with milk are the most common source of calcium for most people.

What is (are) Prescription Drug Abuse ?,"If you take a medicine in a way that is different from what the doctor prescribed, it is called prescription drug abuse. It could be       - Taking a medicine that was prescribed for someone else    - Taking a larger dose than you are supposed to    - Taking the medicine in a different way than you are supposed to. This might be crushing tablets and then snorting or injecting them.    - Using the medicine for another purpose, such as getting high       Abusing some prescription drugs can lead to addiction. These include narcotic painkillers, sedatives, tranquilizers, and stimulants.    Every medicine has some risk of side effects. Doctors take this into account when prescribing medicines. People who abuse these drugs may not understand the risks. The medicines may not be safe for them, especially at higher doses or when taken with other medicines.

What is (are) Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?,"Physical dependence is a normal process that can happen to anyone taking a medication for a long time. It means that the body (including the brain) is adapting to the presence of the drug, and the person may require a higher dosage or a different medication to get relief; this condition is known as tolerance. They may also suffer from withdrawal or feel sick when they stop taking the medication abruptly. However, the symptoms of withdrawal can usually be prevented or managed by a physician, which is why it is so important to talk to a doctor before stopping a medication. Someone who is addicted to a drug may also be physically dependent on it, but rather than benefitting from the drugs effects, an addicted person will continue to get worse with continued or increasing drug abuse. An addicted person compulsively seeks and abuses drugs, despite their negative consequences.) ",674,4
What causes Catheter-related UTI ? (Also called: UTI - catheter associated; Urinary tract infection - catheter associated; Nosocomial UTI; Health care associated UTI; Catheter-associated bacteriuria),"Many types of bacteria or fungi can cause a catheter-related UTI.

How to prevent Catheter-related UTI ? (Also called: UTI - catheter associated; Urinary tract infection - catheter associated; Nosocomial UTI; Health care associated UTI; Catheter-associated bacteriuria),"If you have an indwelling catheter, you must do these things to help prevent infection:  - Clean around the catheter opening every day.  - Clean the catheter with soap and water every day.  - Clean your rectal area thoroughly after every bowel movement.  - Keep your drainage bag lower than your bladder. This prevents the urine in the bag from going back into your bladder.  - Empty the drainage bag at least once every 8 yours, or whenever it is full.  - Have your indwelling catheter changed at least once a month.  - Wash your hands before and after you touch your urine.    Your health care provider might tell you to drink more fluids every day. This is not healthy for everyone, so talk with your doctor before you do this.) ",678,2

What causes Hand-foot-mouth disease ? (Also called: Coxsackievirus infection; HFM disease),"Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is most commonly caused by a virus called coxsackievirus A16.  Children under age 10 are most often affected. Teens and adults can sometimes get the infection. HFMD usually occurs in the summer and early fall.  The virus can spread from person-to-person through tiny, air droplets that are released when the sick person sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose. You can catch hand-foot-mouth disease if:  - A person with the infection sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose near you.  - You touch your nose, eyes, or mouth after you have touched something contaminated by the virus, such as a toy or doorknob.  - You touch stools or fluid from the blisters of an infected person.    The virus is most easily spread the first week a person has the disease.) ",680,6

What causes Hookworm infection ? (Also called: Hookworm disease; Ground itch; Ancylostoma duodenale infection; Necator americanus infection; Parasitic infection - hookworm),"The infection is caused by infestation with any of the following roundworms:  - Necator americanus  - Ancylostoma duodenale  - Ancylostoma ceylanicum  - Ancylostoma braziliense   The first 2 roundworms affect humans only. The last 2 types also occur in animals.  Hookworm disease is common in the moist tropics and subtropics. In developing nations, the disease leads to the death of many children by increasing their risk for infections that their bodies would normally fight off.  There is very little risk of getting the disease in the United States because of advances in sanitation and waste control. The important factor in getting the disease is walking barefoot on ground where there are feces of people who have hookworm.  The larvae (immature form of the worm) enter the skin. The larvae move to the lungs via the bloodstream and enter the airways. The worms are about one half inch long.  After traveling up the windpipe, the larvae are swallowed. After the larvae are swallowed, they infect the small intestine. They develop into adult worms and live there for 1 or more years. The worms attach to the intestinal wall and suck blood, which results in iron deficiency anemia and protein loss. Adult worms and larvae are released in the feces.) ",682,3

What is (are) Huntington disease-like syndrome ? (Also called: Huntington disease-like syndromes; Huntington's disease-like syndromes; Huntington's disease phenocopies; Huntington's disease phenocopy syndromes),"As its name suggests, a Huntington disease-like (HDL) syndrome is a condition that resembles Huntington disease. Researchers have described four HDL syndromes, designated Huntington disease-like 1 (HDL1) through Huntington disease-like 4 (HDL4). These progressive brain disorders are characterized by uncontrolled movements, emotional problems, and loss of thinking ability. HDL syndromes occur in people with the characteristic features of Huntington disease who do not have a mutation in HD, the gene typically associated with that disorder.  HDL1, HDL2, and HDL4 usually appear in early to mid-adulthood, although they can begin earlier in life. The first signs and symptoms of these conditions often include irritability, emotional problems, small involuntary movements, poor coordination, and trouble learning new information or making decisions. Many affected people develop involuntary jerking or twitching movements known as chorea. As the disease progresses, these abnormal movements become more pronounced. Affected individuals may develop problems with walking, speaking, and swallowing. People with these disorders also experience changes in personality and a decline in thinking and reasoning abilities. Individuals with an HDL syndrome can live for a few years to more than a decade after signs and symptoms begin.  HDL3 begins much earlier in life than most of the other HDL syndromes (usually around age 3 or 4). Affected children experience a decline in thinking ability, difficulties with movement and speech, and seizures. Because HDL3 has a somewhat different pattern of signs and symptoms and a different pattern of inheritance, researchers are unsure whether it belongs in the same category as the other HDL syndromes.) ",689,7
What are the genetic changes related to Huntington disease-like syndrome ? (Also called: Huntington disease-like syndromes; Huntington's disease-like syndromes; Huntington's disease phenocopies; Huntington's disease phenocopy syndromes),"In about one percent of people with the characteristic features of Huntington disease, no mutation in the HD gene has been identified. Mutations in the PRNP, JPH3, and TBP genes have been found to cause the signs and symptoms in some of these individuals. HDL1 is caused by mutations in the PRNP gene, while HDL2 results from mutations in JPH3. Mutations in the TBP gene are responsible for HDL4 (also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 17). The genetic cause of HDL3 is unknown.  The PRNP, JPH3, and TBP genes provide instructions for making proteins that are important for normal brain function. The features of HDL syndromes result from a particular type of mutation in any one of these genes. This mutation increases the length of a repeated segment of DNA within the gene, which leads to the production of an abnormal PRNP, JPH3, or TBP protein. The abnormal protein can build up in nerve cells (neurons) and disrupt the normal functions of these cells. The dysfunction and eventual death of neurons in certain areas of the brain underlie the signs and symptoms of HDL syndromes.  Other medical conditions and gene mutations may also cause signs and symptoms resembling Huntington disease. In some affected people, the cause of the disorder is never identified.) ",690,6
What causes Endocarditis ? (Also called: Valve infection; Staphylococcus aureus - endocarditis; Enterococcus - endocarditis; Streptococcus viridans - endocarditis; Candida - endocarditis),"Endocarditis can involve the heart muscle, heart valves, or lining of the heart. Some people who develop endocarditis have a:  - Birth defect of the heart  - Damaged or abnormal heart valve  - History of endocarditis  - New heart valve after surgery    Endocarditis begins when germs enter the bloodstream and then travel to the heart.  - Bacterial infection is the most common cause of endocarditis.  - Endocarditis can also be caused by fungi, such as Candida.  - In some cases, no cause can be found.    Germs are most likely to enter the bloodstream during:  - Central venous access lines  - Injection drug use, from the use of unclean (unsterile) needles  - Recent dental surgery  - Other surgeries or minor procedures to the breathing tract, urinary tract, infected skin, or bones and muscles) ",691,7

What are the genetic changes related to granulomatosis with polyangiitis ? (Also called: GPA; Wegener granulomatosis; Wegener's granulomatosis),"The genetic basis of GPA is not well understood. Having a particular version of the HLA-DPB1 gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for developing this condition, although several other genes, some of which have not been identified, may be involved. It is likely that a combination of genetic and environmental factors lead to GPA.  GPA is an autoimmune disorder. Such disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Approximately 90 percent of people with GPA have an abnormal immune protein called an anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) in their blood. Antibodies normally bind to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction, but ANCAs attack normal human proteins. Most people with GPA have an ANCA that attacks the human protein proteinase 3 (PR3). A few affected individuals have an ANCA that attacks a protein called myeloperoxidase (MPO). When these antibodies attach to the protein they recognize, they trigger inflammation, which contributes to the signs and symptoms of GPA.  The HLA-DPB1 gene belongs to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). Each HLA gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. A particular variant of the HLA-DPB1 gene called HLA-DPB1*0401 has been found more frequently in people with GPA, especially those with ANCAs, than in people without the condition.  Because the HLA-DPB1 gene is involved in the immune system, changes in it might be related to the autoimmune response and inflammation in the respiratory tract and kidneys characteristic of GPA. However, it is unclear what specific role the HLA-DPB1*0401 gene variant plays in development of this condition.) ",701,5
What is (are) Pneumococcal Infections ? (Also called: Streptococcus pneumoniae infections),"Pneumococci are a type of streptococcus bacteria.

The most common types of infections are       - Ear infections    - Sinus infections    - Pneumonia    - Sepsis    - Meningitis       How the diagnosis is made depends upon where the infection is. Your doctor will do a physical exam and health history. Possible tests may include blood, imaging, or lab tests. Treatment is with antibiotics. Vaccines can prevent pneumococcal infections. There are two vaccines. One is for infants and young children. The other is for people at high risk, including those who are over 65 years old, have chronic illnesses or weak immune systems, smoke, have asthma, or live in long-term care facilities.

What causes Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (GN) ? (Also called: Glomerulonephritis - post-streptococcal; Post-infectious glomerulonephritis),"Post-streptococcal GN is a form of glomerulonephritis. It is caused by an infection with a type of streptococcus bacteria. The infection does not occur in the kidneys, but in a different part of the body, such as the skin or throat.  The strep bacterial infection causes the tiny blood vessels in the filtering units of the kidneys (glomeruli) to become inflamed. This makes the kidneys less able to filter the urine.  Post-streptococcal GN is uncommon today because infections that can lead to the disorder are commonly treated with antibiotics. The disorder may develop 1 to 2 weeks after an untreated throat infection, or 3 to 4 weeks after a skin infection.  It may occur in people of any age, but it most often occurs in children ages 6 through 10. Although skin and throat infections are common in children, post-streptococcal GN is a rare complication of these infections.  Risk factors include:  - Strep throat  - Streptococcal skin infections (such as impetigo)) ",703,2
What is (are) granulomatosis with polyangiitis ? (Also called: GPA; Wegener granulomatosis; Wegener's granulomatosis),"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a condition that causes inflammation that primarily affects the respiratory tract (including the lungs and airways) and the kidneys. This disorder is also commonly known as Wegener granulomatosis. A characteristic feature of GPA is inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis), particularly the small- and medium-sized blood vessels in the lungs, nose, sinuses, windpipe, and kidneys, although vessels in any organ can be involved. Polyangiitis refers to the inflammation of multiple types of vessels, such as small arteries and veins. Vasculitis causes scarring and tissue death in the vessels and impedes blood flow to tissues and organs.  Another characteristic feature of GPA is the formation of granulomas, which are small areas of inflammation composed of immune cells that aid in the inflammatory reaction. The granulomas usually occur in the lungs or airways of people with this condition, although they can occur in the eyes or other organs. As granulomas grow, they can invade surrounding areas, causing tissue damage.  The signs and symptoms of GPA vary based on the tissues and organs affected by vasculitis. Many people with this condition experience a vague feeling of discomfort (malaise), fever, weight loss, or other general symptoms of the body's immune reaction. In most people with GPA, inflammation begins in the vessels of the respiratory tract, leading to nasal congestion, frequent nosebleeds, shortness of breath, or coughing. Severe inflammation in the nose can lead to a hole in the tissue that separates the two nostrils (nasal septum perforation) or a collapse of the septum, causing a sunken bridge of the nose (saddle nose).  The kidneys are commonly affected in people with GPA. Tissue damage caused by vasculitis in the kidneys can lead to decreased kidney function, which may cause increased blood pressure or blood in the urine, and life-threatening kidney failure. Inflammation can also occur in other regions of the body, including the eyes, middle and inner ear structures, skin, joints, nerves, heart, and brain. Depending on which systems are involved, additional symptoms can include skin rashes, inner ear pain, swollen and painful joints, and numbness or tingling in the limbs.  GPA is most common in middle-aged adults, although it can occur at any age. If untreated, the condition is usually fatal within 2 years of diagnosis. Even after treatment, vasculitis can return.)

What causes Type 2 diabetes ? (Also called: Noninsulin-dependent diabetes; Diabetes - type 2; Adult-onset diabetes),"Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells, called beta cells. The pancreas is below and behind the stomach. Insulin is needed to move blood sugar (glucose) into cells. Inside the cells, glucose is stored and later used for energy.   When you have type 2 diabetes, your fat, liver, and muscle cells do not respond correctly to insulin. This is called insulin resistance. As a result, blood sugar does not get into these cells to be stored for energy.  When sugar cannot enter cells, a high level of sugar builds up in the blood. This is called hyperglycemia. The body is unable to use the glucose for energy. This leads to the symptoms of type 2 diabetes.  Type 2 diabetes usually develops slowly over time. Most people with the disease are overweight or obese when they are diagnosed. Increased fat makes it harder for your body to use insulin the correct way.  Type 2 diabetes can also develop in people who are thin. This is more common in older adults.  Family history and genes play a role in type 2 diabetes. Low activity level, poor diet, and excess body weight around the waist increase your chance of getting the disease.) ",714,5

What causes Diabetes ? (Also called: Diabetes - type 1; Diabetes - type 2; Diabetes - gestational; Type 1 diabetes; Type 2 diabetes; Gestational diabetes; Diabetes mellitus),"Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.  To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested:  - A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.  - An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel.     People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the bloodinto muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and because their liver makestoo much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either:  - Their pancreas does not make enough insulin  - Their cells do not respond to insulin normally  - Both of the above    There are 2 major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type:   - Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown.  - Type 2 diabetes is much more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease.Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should.  - There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2.    Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes.  If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop the disease.) ",719,5

"What is (are) age-related macular degeneration ? (Also called: age-related maculopathy; AMD; ARMD; macular degeneration, age-related)","Age-related macular degeneration is an eye disease that is a leading cause of vision loss in older people in developed countries. The vision loss usually becomes noticeable in a person's sixties or seventies and tends to worsen over time.  Age-related macular degeneration mainly affects central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. The vision loss in this condition results from a gradual deterioration of light-sensing cells in the tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color (the retina). Specifically, age-related macular degeneration affects a small area near the center of the retina, called the macula, which is responsible for central vision. Side (peripheral) vision and night vision are generally not affected.  Researchers have described two major types of age-related macular degeneration, known as the dry form and the wet form. The dry form is much more common, accounting for 85 to 90 percent of all cases of age-related macular degeneration. It is characterized by a buildup of yellowish deposits called drusen beneath the retina and slowly progressive vision loss. The condition typically affects vision in both eyes, although vision loss often occurs in one eye before the other.  The wet form of age-related macular degeneration is associated with severe vision loss that can worsen rapidly. This form of the condition is characterized by the growth of abnormal, fragile blood vessels underneath the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid, which damages the macula and makes central vision appear blurry and distorted.) ",743,10
"What are the genetic changes related to age-related macular degeneration ? (Also called: age-related maculopathy; AMD; ARMD; macular degeneration, age-related)","Age-related macular degeneration results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Many of these factors have been identified, but some remain unknown.  Researchers have considered changes in many genes as possible risk factors for age-related macular degeneration. The best-studied of these genes are involved in a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. This system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. Genetic changes in and around several complement system genes, including the CFH gene, contribute to a person's risk of developing age-related macular degeneration. It is unclear how these genetic changes are related to the retinal damage and vision loss characteristic of this condition.  Changes on the long (q) arm of chromosome 10 in a region known as 10q26 are also associated with an increased risk of age-related macular degeneration. The 10q26 region contains two genes of interest, ARMS2 and HTRA1. Changes in both genes have been studied as possible risk factors for the disease. However, because the two genes are so close together, it is difficult to tell which gene is associated with age-related macular degeneration risk, or whether increased risk results from variations in both genes.  Other genes that are associated with age-related macular degeneration include genes involved in transporting and processing high-density lipoprotein (HDL, also known as ""good"" cholesterol) and genes that have been associated with other forms of macular disease.  Researchers have also examined nongenetic factors that contribute to the risk of age-related macular degeneration. Age appears to be the most important risk factor; the chance of developing the condition increases significantly as a person gets older. Smoking is another established risk factor for age-related macular degeneration. Other factors that may increase the risk of this condition include high blood pressure, heart disease, a high-fat diet or one that is low in certain nutrients (such as antioxidants and zinc), obesity, and exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight.

What is (are) Macular Degeneration ? (Also called: Age-related macular degeneration; AMD),"Macular degeneration, or age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is a leading cause of vision loss in Americans 60 and older. It is a disease that destroys your sharp, central vision. You need central vision to see objects clearly and to do tasks such as reading and driving.     AMD affects the macula, the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. It does not hurt, but it causes cells in the macula to die. There are two types: wet and dry. Wet AMD happens when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula. These new blood vessels often leak blood and fluid. Wet AMD damages the macula quickly. Blurred vision is a common early symptom. Dry AMD happens when the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down. Your gradually lose your central vision. A common early symptom is that straight lines appear crooked.    Regular comprehensive eye exams can detect macular degeneration before the disease causes vision loss. Treatment can slow vision loss. It does not restore vision.

What is (are) Smoking ? (Also called: Cigar smoking; Cigarette smoking; Pipe smoking; Tobacco smoking),"There's no way around it. Smoking is bad for your health. Smoking harms nearly every organ of the body. Cigarette smoking causes 87 percent of lung cancer deaths. It is also responsible for many other cancers and health problems. These include lung disease, heart and blood vessel disease, stroke and cataracts. Women who smoke have a greater chance of certain pregnancy problems or having a baby die from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Your smoke is also bad for other people - they breathe in your smoke secondhand and can get many of the same problems as smokers do.    E-cigarettes often look like cigarettes, but they work differently. They are battery-operated smoking devices. Not much is known about the health risks of using them.    Quitting smoking can reduce your risk of health problems. The earlier you quit, the greater the benefit.     NIH: National Cancer Institute) ",747,0
What causes Macular degeneration - age-related ? (Also called: Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD); AMD),"The retina is at the back of the eye. It changes light and images that enter the eye into nerve signals that are sent to the brain. A part of the retina called the macula makes vision sharper and more detailed.It is a yellow spot in the center of the retina. It is made up of 2 natural colors (pigments) called lutein and zeaxanthin.  AMD is caused by damage to the blood vessels that supply the macula. This change also harms the macula.  There are two types of AMD:  -  Dry AMD occurs when the blood vessels under the macula become thin and brittle. Small yellow deposits, called drusen, form. Almost all people with macular degeneration start with the dry form.  -  Wet AMD occurs in about 10% of people with macular degeneration. New abnormal and very fragile blood vessels grow under the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid. Thistype of AMDcauses most of the vision loss associated with the condition.   Doctorsare not sure what causes AMD. The condition is rare before age 55. It occurs most inpersons 75 years or older.

"What are the genetic changes related to age-related macular degeneration ? (Also called: age-related maculopathy; AMD; ARMD; macular degeneration, age-related)","Age-related macular degeneration results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Many of these factors have been identified, but some remain unknown.  Researchers have considered changes in many genes as possible risk factors for age-related macular degeneration. The best-studied of these genes are involved in a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. This system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. Genetic changes in and around several complement system genes, including the CFH gene, contribute to a person's risk of developing age-related macular degeneration. It is unclear how these genetic changes are related to the retinal damage and vision loss characteristic of this condition.  Changes on the long (q) arm of chromosome 10 in a region known as 10q26 are also associated with an increased risk of age-related macular degeneration. The 10q26 region contains two genes of interest, ARMS2 and HTRA1. Changes in both genes have been studied as possible risk factors for the disease. However, because the two genes are so close together, it is difficult to tell which gene is associated with age-related macular degeneration risk, or whether increased risk results from variations in both genes.  Other genes that are associated with age-related macular degeneration include genes involved in transporting and processing high-density lipoprotein (HDL, also known as ""good"" cholesterol) and genes that have been associated with other forms of macular disease.  Researchers have also examined nongenetic factors that contribute to the risk of age-related macular degeneration.

What causes Ectopic pregnancy ? (Also called: Tubal pregnancy; Cervical pregnancy; Tubal ligation-ectopic pregnancy),"In most pregnancies, the fertilized egg travels through the fallopian tube to the womb (uterus). If the movement of the egg is blocked or slowed through the tubes, it can lead to an ectopic pregnancy. Things that may cause this problem include:  - Birth defect in the fallopian tubes  - Scarring after a ruptured appendix  - Endometriosis  - Having had a previous ectopic pregnancy  - Scarring from past infections or surgery of the female organs    The following also increase risk of an ectopic pregnancy:  - Age over 35  - Getting pregnant while having an intrauterine device (IUD)  - Having your tubes tied (tubal ligation): This is more likely 2 or more years after the procedure  - Having had surgery to untie tubes (tubal sterilization) to become pregnant  - Having had many sexual partners  - Some infertility treatments    Sometimes the cause is unknown.

What is (are) intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy ? (Also called: obstetric cholestasis; pregnancy-related cholestasis; recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy),"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a liver disorder that occurs in pregnant women. Cholestasis is a condition that impairs the release of a digestive fluid called bile from liver cells. As a result, bile builds up in the liver, impairing liver function. Because the problems with bile release occur within the liver (intrahepatic), the condition is described as intrahepatic cholestasis. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy usually becomes apparent in the third trimester of pregnancy. Bile flow returns to normal after delivery of the baby, and the signs and symptoms of the condition disappear. However, they can return during later pregnancies.  This condition causes severe itchiness (pruritus) in the expectant mother. The itchiness usually begins on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet and then spreads to other parts of the body. Occasionally, affected women have yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). Some studies have shown that women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy are more likely to develop gallstones sometime in their life than women who do not have the condition.  Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy can cause problems for the unborn baby. This condition is associated with an increased risk of premature delivery and stillbirth. Additionally, some infants born to mothers with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy have a slow heart rate and a lack of oxygen during delivery (fetal distress).) ",762,1
What is (are) Ectopic Pregnancy ? (Also called: Abdominal pregnancy; Tubal pregnancy),"The uterus, or womb, is the place where a baby grows when a woman is pregnant. If you have an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg grows in the wrong place, outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tubes. The result is usually a miscarriage.    Ectopic pregnancy can be a medical emergency if it ruptures. Signs of ectopic pregnancy include       - Abdominal pain    - Shoulder pain    - Vaginal bleeding    - Feeling dizzy or faint       Get medical care right away if you have these signs.

Sometimes a partial molar pregnancy can continue. A woman may choose to continue her pregnancy in the hope of having a successful birth and delivery. However, these are very high-risk pregnancies. Risks include bleeding, problems with blood pressure, and premature delivery (having the baby before it is fully developed). Also, the condition may become worse. Women need to thoroughly discuss the risks with their health care provider before continuing the pregnancy.   A hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus) may be an option for older women who do not wish to become pregnant in the future.  After treatment, your hCG level will be followed. It is important to avoid another pregnancy and to use a reliable contraceptive for 6 to 12 months after treatment for a molar pregnancy. This time allows for accurate testing to be sure that the abnormal tissue does not grow back. Women who get pregnant too soon after a molar pregnancy are at high risk of having another molar pregnancy.) ",768,1
What is the outlook for Hydatidiform mole ? (Also called: Hydatid mole; Molar pregnancy),"Most hydatidiform moles are noncancerous (benign). Treatment is usually successful. Close follow-up by your health care provider is important to ensure that signs of the molar pregnancy are gone and pregnancy hormone levels return to normal.   Sometimes hydatidiform moles can continue and start changing into cancer. These moles can grow deep into the uterine wall and cause bleeding or other complications.

Symptoms of infectious arthritis include       - Intense pain in the joint    - Joint redness and swelling    - Chills and fever    - Inability to move the area with the infected joint       One type of infectious arthritis is reactive arthritis. The reaction is to an infection somewhere else in your body. The joint is usually the knee, ankle, or toe. Sometimes, reactive arthritis is set off by an infection in the bladder, or in the urethra, which carries urine out of the body. In women, an infection in the vagina can cause the reaction. For both men and women, it can start with bacteria passed on during sex. Another form of reactive arthritis starts with eating food or handling something that has bacteria on it.    To diagnose infectious arthritis, your health care provider may do tests of your blood, urine, and joint fluid. Treatment includes medicines and sometimes surgery.) ",792,4

What causes Low back pain - chronic ? (Also called: Nonspecific back pain; Backache - chronic; Lumbar pain - chronic; Pain - back - chronic; Chronic back pain - low),"Low back pain is common. Almost everyone has back pain at some time in their life. Often, the exact cause of the pain cannot be found.  A single event may not have caused your pain. You may have been doing many activities, such as lifting the wrong way, for a long time. Then suddenly, one simple movement, such as reaching for something or bending from your waist, leads to pain.  Many people with chronic back pain have arthritis. Or they may have extra wear and tear of the spine, which may be due to:  - Heavy use from work or sports  - Injuries or fractures  - Surgery    You may have had a herniated disk, in which part of the spinal disk pushed onto nearby nerves. Normally, the disks provide space and cushion in your spine. If these disks dry out and become thinner and more brittle, you can lose movement in the spine over time.  If the spaces between the spinal nerves and spinal cord become narrowed, this can lead to spinal stenosis. These problems are called degenerative joint or spine disease.   Other possible causes of chronic low back pain include:  - Curvature of the spine, such as scoliosis or kyphosis  - Medical problems, such as fibromyalgia or rheumatoid arthritis  - Piriformis syndrome, a pain disorder involving a muscle in the buttocks called the piriformis muscle    You are at greater risk for low back pain if you:  - Are over age 30  - Are overweight  - Are pregnant  - Do not exercise  - Feel stressed or depressed  - Have a job in which you have to do heavy lifting, bending and twisting, or that involves whole body vibration, such as truck driving or using a sandblaster  - Smoke) ",844,4

Who should get Estradiol Transdermal Patch and why is it prescribed ?,"Most brands of estradiol transdermal patches are used to treat hot flushes (hot flashes; sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating) and/or vaginal dryness, itching, and burning in women who are experiencing menopause (change of life; the end of monthly menstrual periods). Transdermal estradiol is also used to prevent osteoporosis (a condition in which the bones become thin and weak and break easily) in women who are experiencing or have experienced menopause. Women who need to use transdermal estradiol for more than one of these reasons can benefit most from the medication. Women whose only bothersome symptoms are vaginal dryness, itching, or burning may benefit more from an estrogen product that is applied topically to the vagina. Women who only need a medication to prevent osteoporosis may benefit more from a different medication that does not contain estrogen. Most brands of estradiol transdermal patches are also sometimes used as a source of estrogen in young women who do not produce enough estrogen naturally. Estradiol is in a class of medications called estrogen hormones. It works by replacing estrogen that is normally produced by the body.  Menostar brand patches contain less estrogen than other brands of estradiol transdermal patches. Menostar patches are used only to prevent osteoporosis in women who are experiencing or have experienced menopause.) ",893,0

Always apply your transdermal patch on the same day(s) of the week every week. There may be a calendar on the inner flap of your medication carton where you can keep track of your patch change schedule. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use transdermal estradiol exactly as directed. Do not apply more or fewer patches or apply the patches more often than prescribed by your doctor.  Your doctor will start you on a low dose of transdermal estradiol and may increase your dose if your symptoms are still bothersome. If you are already taking or using an estrogen medication, your doctor will tell you how to switch from the estrogen medication you are taking or using to transdermal estradiol. Be sure you understand these instructions. Talk to your doctor about how well transdermal estradiol works for you.  You should apply estradiol patches to clean, dry, cool skin in the lower stomach area, below your waistline. Some brands of patches may also be applied to the upper buttocks or the hips.

Be sure that the skin in the area where you plan to apply an estradiol patch is free of lotion, powders, or creams. After you apply a patch to a particular area, wait at least 1 week before applying another patch to that spot. Some brands of patches should not be applied to an area of the skin that is exposed to sunlight.

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist or read the manufacturer's information that came with your medication to find out if you need to be careful when you swim, bathe, shower, or use a sauna while wearing an estradiol transdermal patch. Some brands of patches are not likely to be affected by these activities, but some brands of patches may loosen. Some types of patches may also be pulled and loosened by your clothes or towel when you change clothes or dry your body. You may need to check that your patch is still firmly attached after these activities.  If the patch loosens or falls off before it is time to replace it, try to press it back in place with your fingers.

Do not use scissors because they may damage the patch. Do not open the pouch until you are ready to apply the patch.  - Remove the patch from the pouch. There may be a silver foil sticker used to protect the patch from moisture inside the pouch. Do not remove this sticker from the pouch.  - Remove the protective liner from the patch and press the sticky side of the patch against your skin in the area you have chosen to wear your patch. Some patches have a liner that is made to peel off in two pieces. If your patch has that type of liner, you should peel off one part of the liner and press that side of the patch against your skin. Then fold back the patch, peel off the other part of the liner and press the second side of the patch against your skin. Always be careful not to touch the sticky side of the patch with your fingers.  - Press down on the patch with your fingers or palm for 10 seconds. Be sure that the patch is firmly attached to your skin, especially around its edges.  - Wear the patch all the time until it is time to remove it. When it is time to remove the patch, slowly peel it off of your skin. Fold the patch in half so that the sticky sides are pressed together and throw it away in a trash can that is out of reach of children and pets.  - Some brands of patches may leave a sticky substance on your skin. In some cases, this can be rubbed off easily. In other cases, you should wait 15 minutes and then remove the substance using an oil or lotion.

What important warning or information should I know about Estradiol Transdermal Patch ?,"Estradiol increases the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the uterus [womb]). The longer you use estradiol, the greater the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer. If you have not had a hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus), you should be given another medication called a progestin to take with transdermal estradiol. This may decrease your risk of developing endometrial cancer but may increase your risk of developing certain other health problems, including breast cancer. Before you begin using transdermal estradiol, tell your doctor if you have or have ever had cancer and if you have unusual vaginal bleeding. Call your doctor immediately if you have abnormal or unusual vaginal bleeding during your treatment with transdermal estradiol. Your doctor will watch you closely to help ensure you do not develop endometrial cancer during or after your treatment.  In a large study, women who took estrogens (a group of medications that includes estradiol) by mouth with progestins had a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots in the lungs or legs, breast cancer, and dementia (loss of ability to think, learn, and understand). Women who use transdermal estradiol alone or with progestins may also have a higher risk of developing these conditions. Tell your doctor if you smoke or use tobacco, if you have had a heart attack or a stroke in the past year, and if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had blood clots or breast cancer. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had high blood pressure, high blood levels of cholesterol or fats, diabetes, heart disease, lupus ( a condition in which the body attacks its own tissues causing damage and swelling), breast lumps, or an abnormal mammogram (x-ray of the breast used to find breast cancer).  The following symptoms can be signs of the serious health conditions listed above. Call your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms while you are using transdermal estradiol: sudden, severe headache; sudden, severe vomiting; speech problems; dizziness or faintness; sudden complete or partial loss of vision; double vision; weakness or numbness of an arm or a leg; crushing chest pain or chest heaviness; coughing up blood; sudden shortness of breath; difficulty thinking clearly, remembering, or learning new things; breast lumps or other breast changes; discharge from nipples; or pain, tenderness, or redness in one leg.  You can take steps to decrease the risk that you will develop a serious health problem while you are using transdermal estradiol. Do not use transdermal estradiol alone or with a progestin to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia. Use the lowest dose of transdermal estradiol that controls your symptoms and only use transdermal estradiol as long as needed. Talk to your doctor every 3 to 6 months to decide if you should use a lower dose of transdermal estradiol or should stop using the medication.  You should examine your breasts every month and have a mammogram and a breast exam performed by a doctor every year to help detect breast cancer as early as possible. Your doctor will tell you how to properly examine your breasts and whether you should have these exams more often than once a year because of your personal or family medical history.  Tell your doctor if you are having surgery or will be on bedrest. Your doctor may tell you to stop using transdermal estradiol 4 to 6 weeks before the surgery or bedrest to decrease the risk that you will develop blood clots.  Talk to your doctor regularly about the risks and benefits of using transdermal estradiol.) ",901,4

What is (are) Alcohol use and safe drinking ? (Also called: Beer consumption; Wine consumption; Hard liquor consumption; Safe drinking),"Alcohol is one of the most widely used drug substances in the world.  TEEN DRINKING  Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month. This is in spite of the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the U.S.  About 1 in 5 teens are considered ""problem drinkers."" This means that they:  - Get drunk  - Have accidents related to alcohol use  - Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol    THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL  Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them:  - Beer is about 5% alcohol, although some beers can have more.  - Wine is usually 12 to 15% alcohol.  - Hard liquor is about 45% alcohol.    Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.  The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.  Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster.Stronger drinks tend to be absorbed faster.  Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your ""blood alcohol level."" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.  Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The legal limit for blood alcohol usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms:  - 0.05 -- reduced inhibitions  - 0.10 -- slurred speech  - 0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment  - 0.30 -- confusion  - 0.40 -- stupor  - 0.50 -- coma  - 0.60 -- respiratory paralysis and death    You can have symptoms of ""being drunk"" at blood alcohol levels below the legal definition of being drunk. Also, people who drink alcohol frequently may not have symptoms until a higher blood alcohol level is reached.  HEALTH RISKS OF ALCOHOL  Alcohol increases the risk of:  - Alcoholism  - Falls, drownings, and other accidents  - Head, neck, stomach, and breast cancers  - Motor vehicle accidents  - Risky sex behaviors, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  - Suicide and homicide    Drinking during pregnancy can harm the developing baby. Severe birth defects or fetal alcohol syndrome are possible.  RESPONSIBLE DRINKING  If you drink alcohol, it is best to do so in moderation. Moderation means the drinking is not getting you intoxicated (or drunk) and you are drinking no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman and no more than 2 if you are a man. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 ounces of liquor.  Here are some ways to drink responsibly, provided you do not have a drinking problem, are of legal age to drink alcohol, and are not pregnant:  - Never drink alcohol and drive a car.  - If you are going to drink, have a designated driver, or plan an alternative way home, such as a taxi or bus.  - Do not drink on an empty stomach. Snack before and while drinking alcohol.    If you are taking medication, including over-the-counter drugs, check with your doctor before drinking alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of many medicines stronger. It can also interact with other medicines, making them ineffective or dangerous or make you sick.  If alcohol use runs in your family, you may be at increased risk of developing this disease yourself. So, you may want to avoid drinking alcohol altogether.  CALL YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IF:  - You are concerned about your personal alcohol use or that of a family member  - You are interested in more information regarding alcohol use or support groups  - You are unable to reduce or stop your alcohol consumption, in spite of attempts to stop drinking    Other resources include:  - Local Alcoholics Anonymous or Al-anon/Alateen groups  - Local hospitals  - Public or private mental health agencies  - School or work counselors  - Student or employee health centers) ",903,2

But stress that goes on for more than a few weeks can affect your health. Keep stress from making you sick by learning healthy ways to manage it.  LEARN TO RECOGNIZE STRESS  The first step in managing stress is recognizing it in your life. Everyone feels stress in a different way. You may get angry or irritable, lose sleep, or have headaches or stomach upset. What are your signs of stress? Once you know what signals to look for, you can start to manage it.  Also identify the situations that cause you stress. These are called stressors. Your stressors could be family, work, relationships, money, or health problems. Once you understand where your stress is coming from, you can come up with ways to deal with your stressors.  AVOID UNHEALTHY STRESS RELIEF  When you feel stressed, you may fall back on unhealthy behaviors to help you relax. These may include:  - Eating too much  - Smoking cigarettes  - Drinking alcohol or using drugs  - Sleeping too much or not sleeping enough    These behaviors may help you feel better at first, but they may hurt you more than they help. Instead, use the tips below to find healthy ways to reduce your stress.  FIND HEALTHY STRESS BUSTERS  There are many healthy ways to manage stress. Try a few and see which ones work best for you.  - Recognize the things you can't change. Accepting that you can't change certain things allows you to let go and not get upset. For instance, you cannot change the fact that you have to drive during rush hour. But you can look for ways to relax during your commute, such as listening to a podcast or book.  - Avoid stressful situations. When you can, remove yourself from the source of stress. For example, if your family squabbles during the holidays, give yourself a breather and go out for a walk or drive.  - Get exercise. Getting physical activity every day is one of the easiest -- and best -- ways to cope with stress. When you exercise, your brain releases chemicals that make you feel good. It can also help you release built-up energy or frustration. Find something you enjoy -- whether it is walking, cycling, softball, swimming, or dancing -- and do it for at least 30 minutes on most days.  - Change your outlook. Try to develop a more positive attitude toward challenges. You can do this by replacing negative thoughts with more positive ones. For example, rather than thinking, ""Why does everything always go wrong?"" change this thought to, ""I can find a way to get through this."" It may seem hard or silly at first, but with practice you may find it helps turn your outlook around.  - Do something you enjoy. When stress has you down, do something you enjoy to help pick you up. It could be as simple as reading a good book, listening to music, watching a favorite movie, or having dinner with a friend. Or, take up a new hobby or class. Whatever you choose, try to do at least one thing a day that's just for you.  - Learn new ways to relax. Practicing relaxation techniques is a great way to handle daily stress. Relaxation techniques help slow your heart rate and lower your blood pressure. There are many types, from deep breathing and meditation to yoga and tai chi. Take a class, or try learning from books, videos, or online sources.  - Connect with loved ones. Do not let stress get in the way of being social. Spending time with family and friends can help you feel better and forget about your stress. Confiding in a friend may also help you work out your problems.  - Get enough sleep. Getting a good night's sleep can help you think more clearly and have more energy. This will make it easier to handle any problems that crop up. Aim for about 7 to 9 hours each night.  - Eat a healthy diet. Eating healthy foods helps fuel your body and mind. Skip the high-sugar snack foods and load up on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat or nonfat dairy, and lean proteins.  - Learn to say no. If your stress comes from taking on too much at home or work, learn to set limits. Ask others for help when you need it.    RESOURCES  If you can't manage stress on your own, you may want to talk with your health care provider. Or consider seeing a therapist or counselor who can help you find other ways to deal with your stress. Depending on the cause of your stress, you also may find it helps to join a support group.)

However, seemingly unlikely or unusual sources are found every decade, with the common problem of improper handling during manufacture, at retail, or by consumers; some examples are chopped garlic in oil, canned cheese sauce, chile peppers, tomatoes, carrot juice, and baked potatoes wrapped in foil. In Alaska, foodborne botulism is caused by fermented fish and other aquatic game foods. Persons who do home canning should follow strict hygienic procedures to reduce contamination of foods, and carefully follow instructions on safe home canning including the use of pressure canners/cookers as recommended through county extension services or from the US Department of Agriculture. Oils infused with garlic or herbs should be refrigerated. Potatoes which have been baked while wrapped in aluminum foil should be kept hot until served or refrigerated. Because the botulinum toxin is destroyed by high temperatures, persons who eat home-canned foods should consider boiling the food for 10 minutes before eating it to ensure safety. Wound botulism can be prevented by promptly seeking medical care for infected wounds and by not using injectable street drugs. Most infant botulism cases cannot be prevented because the bacteria that causes this disease is in soil and dust.  The bacteria can be found inside homes on floors, carpet, and countertops even after cleaning.  Honey can contain the bacteria that causes infant botulism so, children less than 12 months old should not be fed honey. Honey is safe for persons 1 year of age and older.) ",970,4
how can hps be prevented for Hantavirus ?,"Eliminate or minimize contact with rodents in your home, workplace, or campsite. If rodents don't find that where you are is a good place for them to be, then you're less likely to come into contact with them. Seal up holes and gaps in your home or garage. Place traps in and around your home to decrease rodent infestation. Clean up any easy-to-get food.",971,2

What is (are) Learning Disorders ? (Also called: Learning differences; Learning disabilities),"Learning disorders affect how a person understands, remembers and responds to new information. People with learning disorders may have problems       - Listening or paying attention    - Speaking    - Reading or writing    - Doing math       Although learning disorders occur in very young children, they are usually not recognized until the child reaches school age. About one-third of children who have learning disabilities also have ADHD, which makes it hard to focus.     Evaluation and testing by a trained professional can help identify a learning disorder. The next step is special education, which involves helping your child in the areas where he or she needs the most help. Sometimes tutors or speech or language therapists also work with the children.

What is (are) Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome ?,"Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a growth disorder that causes large body size, large organs, and other symptoms. It is a congenital condition, which means it is present at birth. The signs and symptoms of the disorder vary somewhat from child to child.  Infancy can be a critical period in babies with this condition because of the possibility of:  - Low blood sugar  - A type of hernia called an omphalocele (when present)  - An enlarged tongue (macroglossia)  - An increased rate of tumor growth. Wilms tumors and hepatoblastomas are the most common tumors in children with this syndrome.) ",983,6

What is (are) Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome ? (Also called: BWS; Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS)),"Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time.  The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities.  Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor and a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood.  Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.) ",989,7
How many people are affected by Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome ? (Also called: BWS; Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS)),"Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome affects an estimated 1 in 13,700 newborns worldwide. The condition may actually be more common than this estimate because some people with mild symptoms are never diagnosed.) ",990,10
What are the genetic changes related to Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome ? (Also called: BWS; Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS)),"The genetic causes of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are complex. The condition usually results from the abnormal regulation of genes in a particular region of chromosome 11. People normally inherit one copy of this chromosome from each parent. For most genes on chromosome 11, both copies of the gene are expressed, or ""turned on,"" in cells. For some genes, however, only the copy inherited from a person's father (the paternally inherited copy) is expressed. For other genes, only the copy inherited from a person's mother (the maternally inherited copy) is expressed. These parent-specific differences in gene expression are caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. Abnormalities involving genes on chromosome 11 that undergo genomic imprinting are responsible for most cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.  At least half of all cases result from changes in a process called methylation. Methylation is a chemical reaction that attaches small molecules called methyl groups to certain segments of DNA. In genes that undergo genomic imprinting, methylation is one way that a gene's parent of origin is marked during the formation of egg and sperm cells. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is often associated with changes in regions of DNA on chromosome 11 called imprinting centers (ICs). ICs control the methylation of several genes that are involved in normal growth, including the CDKN1C, H19, IGF2, and KCNQ1OT1 genes. Abnormal methylation disrupts the regulation of these genes, which leads to overgrowth and the other characteristic features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.  About twenty percent of cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are caused by a genetic change known as paternal uniparental disomy (UPD). Paternal UPD causes people to have two active copies of paternally inherited genes rather than one active copy from the father and one inactive copy from the mother. People with paternal UPD are also missing genes that are active only on the maternally inherited copy of the chromosome. In Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, paternal UPD usually occurs early in embryonic development and affects only some of the body's cells. This phenomenon is called mosaicism. Mosaic paternal UPD leads to an imbalance in active paternal and maternal genes on chromosome 11, which underlies the signs and symptoms of the disorder.  Less commonly, mutations in the CDKN1C gene cause Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control growth before birth. Mutations in the CDKN1C gene prevent this protein from restraining growth, which leads to the abnormalities characteristic of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.  About 1 percent of all people with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have a chromosomal abnormality such as a rearrangement (translocation), abnormal copying (duplication), or loss (deletion) of genetic material from chromosome 11. Like the other genetic changes responsible for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, these abnormalities disrupt the normal regulation of certain genes on this chromosome.) ",991,7
Is Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome inherited ? (Also called: BWS; Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS)),"In about 85 percent of cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, only one person in a family has been diagnosed with the condition. However, parents of one child with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome may be at risk of having other children with the disorder. This risk depends on the genetic cause of the condition.  Another 10 to 15 percent of people with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are part of families with more than one affected family member. In most of these families, the condition appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of an altered gene in each cell is typically sufficient to cause the disorder. In most of these cases, individuals with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome inherit the genetic change from their mothers. Occasionally, a person who inherits the altered gene will not have any of the characteristic signs and symptoms of the condition.  Rarely, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome results from changes in the structure of chromosome 11. Some of these chromosomal abnormalities are inherited from a parent, while others occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in the earliest stages of development before birth.)

Do you have information about Choosing the best doctor,"When it is time to find a new doctor, you want to choose someone you can trust. How can you find out the truth about your doctor? While many doctors are caring, professional, and competent, some are not. Fortunately, there are ways to check a doctor's credentials and standing. Use the resources below to learn about your doctor before you start working together. Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB)  The FSMB has a list of state medical board websites -- www.fsmb.org/pdf/GRPOL_Physician_Profiling.pdf. You can look up your doctor on the state site to see if he or she is licensed to practice in your state. Not all states provide the same amount of information. Some only share state license and board actions against the doctor. Others include actions taken in other states, medical malpractice, disciplinary actions, awards, and more. If your state doesn't provide this information, you may be able to request it.  Other health care providers, such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants are also licensed by states. Most states have a similar search for all licensed medical providers.  For a more complete picture, you can order a doctor profile from the FSMB -- www.docinfo.org for $9.95. The FSMB collects data on doctors, osteopaths, and most physician assistants who are licensed to practice in the U.S. The profile includes:  - Physician disciplinary sanctions  - Education: medical school name, year of graduation, and degree earned  - Medical specialty  - Location information   HealthGrades  HealthGrades -- www.healthgrades.com gathers data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and state medical boards. You can use this free website to get information about your doctor, as well as about local hospitals. You can get information on a doctor's:  - Experience  - Education and training  - Procedures performed  - Conditions treated  - Malpractice claims, sanctions, and board actions  - Awards  - Languages spoken    The site also collects patient satisfaction surveys from site users. NCQA Recognition Directory  The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) -- recognition.ncqa.org is a not-for-profit organization committed to improving health care quality. You can search their database of doctors to see who in your area participates in NCQA recognition programs. Participation means that the doctor is focused on providing quality care and follows the latest patient care methods. Prescriber Checkup and Dollars for Doctors  These pages are run by ProPublica, a nonprofit news organization. ProPublica produces investigative journalism in the public interest. Using Dollars for Doctors -- www.propublica.org/series/dollars-for-docs, you can check to see whether your doctor has received money from a drug company. With Prescriber Checkup -- projects.propublica.org/checkup, you can view your doctor's prescribing habits compared to the average doctor. These sites use prescribing data from Medicare Part D. This means that most of the information is based on prescriptions written for older adults and people with disabilities. These groups tend to use more prescription drugs. Some Things to Keep in Mind  While these sites can help you find out about your doctor, they are not foolproof. Most of the information you will find is from lawsuits that have been settled. If any complaints are still in process, you won't see them. Keep in mind that doctors in certain specialties may be more likely to be sued. And not all lawsuits mean that the doctor did something wrong.  Your health care provider may be a nurse practitioner or physician assistant. There are different sites to check on certification and specialization for these providers.  Use care when reviewing patient satisfaction scores. You are more likely to see telltale trends if a health care provider has been reviewed by 40 people rather than 4. Read the results closely. Poor scores for this office don't necessarily reflect on the health care provider, who may be one of many providers in a busy practice.) ",995,4

What to do for Drug abuse first aid ? (Also called: Overdose from drugs),"Many street drugs have no therapeutic benefits. Any use of these drugs is a form of drug abuse.  Legitimate medications can be abused by people who take more than the recommended dose or who intentionally take them with alcohol or other drugs.  Drug interactions may also produce adverse effects. Therefore, it is important to let your doctor know about all the drugs you are taking, including vitamins and other over-the-counter medications.  Many drugs are addictive. Sometimes the addiction is gradual. However, some drugs (such as cocaine) can cause addiction after only a few doses.  Someone who has become addicted to a drug usually will have withdrawal symptoms when the drug is suddenly stopped. Withdrawal is greatly assisted by professional help.  A drug dose that is large enough to be toxic is called an overdose. This may occur suddenly, when a large amount of the drug is taken at one time, or gradually, as a drug builds up in the body over a longer period of time. Prompt medical attention may save the life of someone who accidentally or deliberately takes an overdose.) ",998,2

What is (are) Drug allergies ? (Also called: Allergic reaction - drug (medication); Drug hypersensitivity; Medication hypersensitivity),Drug allergies are a group of symptoms caused by an allergic reaction to a drug (medication).) ,1002,2
What causes Drug allergies ? (Also called: Allergic reaction - drug (medication); Drug hypersensitivity; Medication hypersensitivity),"Adverse reactions to drugs are common. (adverse means unwanted or unexpected.) Almost any drug can cause an adverse reaction. Reactions range from irritating or mild side effects such as nausea and vomiting to life-threatening anaphylaxis.  A true drug allergy is caused by a series of chemical steps in the body that produce the allergic reaction to a medication.  The first time you take the medicine, you may have no problems. However, your body's immune system may produce a substance (antibody) called IgE against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the IgE tells your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine, which causes your allergy symptoms. A drug allergy may also occur without your body producing IgE. Instead, it might produce other types of antibodies, or have other reactions that do not produce antibodies.  Most drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. Serum sickness is a delayed type of drug allergy that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medication or vaccine.  Common allergy-causing drugs include:  -  Anticonvulsants   -  Insulin (especially animal sources of insulin)   -  Iodinated (containing iodine) x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like reactions)   -  Penicillin and related antibiotics   -  Sulfa drugs    Most side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction. For example, aspirin can cause nonallergic hives or trigger asthma. Some drug reactions are considered idiosyncratic. This means the reaction is an unusual effect of the medication. It is not due to a known chemical effect of the drug. Many people confuse an uncomfortable, but not serious, side effect of a medicine (such as nausea) with a true drug allergy.) ",1003,2
What are the treatments for Drug allergies ? (Also called: Allergic reaction - drug (medication); Drug hypersensitivity; Medication hypersensitivity),"The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent a severe reaction.  Treatment may include:  -  Antihistamines to relieve mild symptoms such as rash, hives, and itching   -  Bronchodilators such as albuterol to reduce asthma-like symptoms (moderate wheezing or cough)   -  Corticosteroids applied to the skin, given by mouth, or given through a vein (intravenously)   - Epinephrine by injection to treat anaphylaxis    The offending medication and similar drugs should be avoided. Make sure all your health care providers -- including dentists and hospital staff -- know about any drug allergies that you or your children have.  In some cases, a penicillin (or other drug) allergy responds to desensitization. This treatment involves being given larger and larger doses of a medicine to improve your tolerance of the drug. The desensitization should be done only by an allergist, when there is no alternative drug for you to take.) ",1004,2
How to prevent Drug allergies ? (Also called: Allergic reaction - drug (medication); Drug hypersensitivity; Medication hypersensitivity),"There is generally no way to prevent a drug allergy.  If you have a known drug allergy, avoiding the medication is the best way to prevent an allergic reaction. You may also be told to avoid similar medicines.  In some cases, a health care provider may approve the use of a drug that causes an allergy if you are first treated with corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine). Do not try this without a health care provider's supervision. Pretreatment with corticosteroids and antihistamines has been shown to prevent anaphylaxis in people who need to get x-ray contrast dye.  Your health care provider may also recommend densensitization.) ",1005,2
What are the treatments for Drug-induced lupus erythematosus ?

What are the treatments for Drug-induced tremor ? (Also called: Tremor - drug-induced),"Drug-induced tremor usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine that is causing the shaking.  You may not need treatment or changes in the medicine if the tremor is mild and does not interfere with your daily activity.  If the benefit of the medicine is greater than the problems caused by the tremor, your doctor may have you try different dosages of the medicine, or you may be prescribed another medicine to treat your condition. In rare cases, a drug such as propranolol may be added to help control the tremor.   Do not stop taking any medicine without first talking to your health care provider.) ",1008,1
Do you have information about How to choose the best hospital for surgery,"The quality of the health care you receive depends on many things besides the skill of your surgeon. Many health care providers at a hospital will be directly involved in your care before, during, and after surgery.  The work of all the hospital staff affects how well the hospital functions. This affects your safety and the quality of the care you will receive there.  CHOOSING THE BEST HOSPITAL FOR SURGERY  A hospital can offer many things to improve the quality of care you receive. For example, find out if your hospital has:  - A floor or unit that does only the type of surgery you are having (For example, for hip replacement surgery, do they have a floor or unit that is used only for joint-replacement surgeries?)  - Operating rooms that are used only for your type of surgery  - Specific guidelines so that everyone who has your type of surgery receives the kind of care they need  - Enough nurses    It can also be helpful to know how many surgeries like yours have been done at the hospital you have chosen or are considering for your surgery. People who have surgery at hospitals that do more of the same type of procedure often do better.  If you are having a surgery that involves newer techniques, find out how many of these procedures your hospital has already done.  HIGH-QUALITY MEASURES  Hospitals are asked to report events called ""quality measures."" These measures are reports of different things that affect patient care. Some common quality measures include:  - Patient injuries, such as falls  - Patients who receive the wrong medicine or the wrong dosage of a medicine  - Complications, such as infections, blood clots, and pressure ulcers (bedsores)  - Readmission and death (mortality) rates    Hospitals receive scores for their quality. These scores can give you an idea of how your hospital compares to other hospitals.  Find out if your hospital is accredited by The Joint Commission (a nonprofit organization that seeks to improve the quality and safety of health care).  Also see if your hospital is rated highly by state agencies or consumer or other groups. Some places to look for hospital ratings are:  - State reports -- some states require hospitals to report certain information to them, and some publish reports that compare hospitals in the state.  - Nonprofit groups in some areas or states work with businesses, doctors, and hospitals to gather information about quality. You can look for this information online.  - The government gathers and reports information about hospitals. You can find this information online at www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov. You can also find information about choosing the best doctor online.  - Your health insurance company may rate and compare how different hospitals perform on the surgery you are having.

What causes Anemia caused by low iron - infants and toddlers ? (Also called: Anemia - iron deficiency- infants and toddlers),"Anemia caused by a low iron level is the most common form of anemia. The body gets iron through certain foods. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells.  A diet that does not have enough iron is the most common cause. During periods of rapid growth, even more iron is needed.  Babies are born with iron stored in their bodies. Because they grow rapidly, infants and toddlers need to absorb a lot of iron each day. Iron deficiency anemia most commonly affects babies 9 through 24 months old.   Breastfed babies need less iron because iron is absorbed better when it is in breast milk. Formula with iron added (iron fortified) also provides enough iron.  Infants younger than 12 months who drink cow's milk rather than breast milk or iron-fortified formula are more likely to have anemia. Cow's milk leads to anemia because it:  - Has less iron  - Causes small amounts of blood loss from the intestines  - Makes it harder for the body to absorb iron   Children older than 12 months who drink too much cow's milk may also have anemia if they do not eat enough other healthy foods that have iron.)

What causes Benign positional vertigo ? (Also called: Vertigo - positional; Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; BPPV: dizziness- positional),"Benign positional vertigo is also called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). It is caused by a problem in the inner ear.   The inner ear has fluid-filled tubes called semicircular canals. When you move, the fluid moves inside these tubes. The canals are very sensitive to any movement of the fluid. The sensation of the fluid moving in the tube tells your brain the position of your body. This helps you keep your balance.  BPPV occurs when a small piece of bone-like calcium breaks free and floats inside the tube. This sends confusing messages to your brain about your body's position.  BPPV has no major risk factors. But, your risk for developing BPPV may increase if you have:  - Family members with BPPV  - Had a prior head injury (even a slight bump to the head)  - Had an inner ear infection called labyrinthitis) ",1031,2

Infants with Emanuel syndrome have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and fail to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Their development is significantly delayed, and most affected individuals have severe to profound intellectual disability.  Other features of Emanuel syndrome include an unusually small head (microcephaly), distinctive facial features, and a small lower jaw (micrognathia). Ear abnormalities are common, including small holes in the skin just in front of the ears (preauricular pits or sinuses).

In addition to the usual 46 chromosomes, people with Emanuel syndrome have an extra (supernumerary) chromosome consisting of a piece of chromosome 11 attached to a piece of chromosome 22. The extra chromosome is known as a derivative 22 or der(22) chromosome.  As a result of the extra chromosome, people with Emanuel syndrome have three copies of some genes in each cell instead of the usual two copies. The excess genetic material disrupts the normal course of development, leading to the characteristic signs and symptoms of this disorder. Researchers are working to determine which genes are included on the der(22) chromosome and what role these genes play in development.) ",1049,10

The parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement between chromosomes 11 and 22 called a balanced translocation. No genetic material is gained or lost in a balanced translocation, so these chromosomal changes usually do not cause any health problems. However, translocations can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. Individuals with Emanuel syndrome inherit an unbalanced translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22 that introduces extra genetic material in the form of the der(22) chromosome. This extra genetic material causes birth defects and the other health problems characteristic of this disorder.) ",1050,7

What is (are) Back pain - when you see the doctor ?,"Questions your provider may ask may include:  - Is your back pain on one side only or both sides?  - What does the pain feel like? Is it dull, sharp, throbbing, or burning?  - Is this the first time you have had back pain?  - When did the pain begin? Did it start suddenly?  - Did you have an injury or accident?  - What were you doing just before the pain began? For example, were you lifting or bending? Sitting at your computer? Driving a long distance?  - If you have had back pain before, is this pain similar or different? In what way is it different?  - Do you know what caused your back pain in the past?  - How long does each episode of back pain usually last?  - Do you feel the pain anywhere else, such as in your hip, thigh, leg or feet?  - Do you have any numbness or tingling? Any weakness or loss of function in your leg or elsewhere?  - What makes the pain worse? Lifting, twisting, standing, or sitting for long periods?  - What makes you feel better?    You will also be asked if you have other symptoms, which may point to a more serious cause. Tell your provider if you have had weight loss, fever, a change in urination or bowel habits, or a history of cancer.  Your provider will perform a physical exam to try to find the exact location of your pain, and determine how it affects your movement. Your back will be pressed on in different spots to find where it hurts. You will also be asked to:  - Sit, stand, and walk  - Walk on your toes and then your heels  - Bend forward, backward, and sideways  - Lift your legs straight up while lying down    If the pain is worse when you lift your legs straight up while lying down, you may have sciatica, especially if you also feel numbness or tingling going down the same leg.  Your provider will also move your legs into different positions, including bending and straightening your knees.  A rubber hammer is used to check your reflexes and to see if your nerves are working properly. Your provider will touch your skin in many places, using a pin, cotton swab, or feather. This reveals how well you can feel or sense things.) ",1055,4
Do you have information about Child safety seats (Also called: Child car seats; Infant car seats; Car seats; Car safety seats),"Child safety seats are proven to save children's lives in accidents.  In the United States, all states require children to be secured in a car seat or booster seat until they are 4' 9"" tall. Most children grow to this height when they are between 8 and 12 years old.  To keep your child safe, keep these tips in mind when using a car safety seat.  - When your child is born, you must have a car seat to bring the baby home from the hospital.  - Always secure your child in a car seat whenever riding in a vehicle. Make sure the harness is fastened snugly.  - Read the car seat manufacturer's instructions for the proper way to use the seat. Read your vehicle owner's manual, too.  - Car seats and booster seats should always be used on the back seat of a vehicle. If there is no back seat, the car seat can be secured on the front passenger seat. This can ONLY be done when there is no front or side air bag, or the air bag has been switched off.    When you are selecting a child safety seat for the first time:  - The seat must fit your child's size and be able to be properly installed in your vehicle.  - It is best to use a new car seat. Used car seats often do not have instructions. They may have cracks or other problems that make the seat unsafe. For example, the seat may have been damaged during a car accident.  - Try the seat before buying it. Install the seat in your vehicle. Put your child in the car seat. Secure the harness and buckle. Check that the seat fits your vehicle and child.  - DO NOT use a car seat past its expiration date. The seat frame may no longer be strong enough to support your child safely. The expiration date is usually on the bottom of the seat.  - DO NOT use a seat that has been recalled. Fill out and send in the registration card that comes with the new car seat. The manufacturer can contact you if the seat is recalled. You can find out about recalls by contacting the manufacturer, or by looking up safety complaints records on your child's safety seat at www.safercar.gov/parents/CarSeats/Car-Seat-Safety.htm.    The types of child safety seats and restraints include:  - Rear-facing seats  - Forward-facing seats  - Booster seats  - Car beds  - Built-in car seats  - Travel vests    REAR-FACING SEATS   A rear-facing seat is one in which your child faces the back of the vehicle. The seat should be installed on the back seat of your vehicle. The two types of rear-facing seats are the infant-only seat and the convertible seat.  Infant-only rear-facing seats. These seats are for babies who weigh up to 22 to 30 pounds, depending on the car seat. You will need a new seat when your child gets bigger. Infant-only seats have handles so you can carry the seat to and from the car. Some have a base you can leave installed in the car. This lets you click the car seat into place each time you use it. Follow manufacturer's instructions on how the seat should be reclined so your baby's head does not shift around while you are driving.  Convertible seats. These seats are to be placed in the rear-facing position and are for infants and toddlers. When your child is older and bigger, the seat can be switched to the forward-facing position. Experts recommend keeping your child rear-facing until at least age 2 and until your child outgrows the weight or height allowed by the seat.  FORWARD-FACING SEATS   A forward-facing seat should be installed on the back seat of your vehicle, although it allows your child to face the front of the car. These seats are used only after your child is too big for a rear-facing seat.  A combination forward-facing booster seat may also be used. For younger children, the booster seat's harness straps should be used. After your child reaches the upper height and weight limit for the harness (based on the seat's instructions), the vehicle's own lap and shoulder belts can be used to keep your child strapped in.   BOOSTER SEATS  A booster seat raises your child up so the vehicle's own lap and shoulder belts fit correctly. The lap belt should fall across your child's upper thighs. The shoulder belt should go across the middle of your child's shoulder and chest.  Use booster seats for older children until they are 4' 9"" tall and between 8 and 12 years old.  CAR BEDS  These seats are also called flat car seats. They are used for premature or other special-needs babies. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends having a health care provider look at how your preterm baby fits and breathes in a car seat before leaving the hospital.  BUILT-IN SEATS  Some vehicles have built-in car seats. Weight and height limits vary. You can get more details on these seats by reading the vehicle owner's manual or calling the vehicle manufacturer.  TRAVEL VESTS  Special vests can be worn by older children who have outgrown forward-facing safety seats. The vests can be used instead of booster seats. The vests are used with the vehicle's lap and seat belts. As with car seats, children should be sitting in the back seat when using the vest.) ",1056,10

Do you have information about Toddler development,"Toddlers are children ages 1 - 3.  CHILD DEVELOPMENT THEORIES  Cognitive (thought) development skills typical for toddlers include:  - Early use of instruments or tools  - Following visual (then later, invisible) displacement (moving from one place to another) of objects  - Understanding that objects and people are there, even if you can't see them (object and people permanence)    Personal-social development in the toddler stage focuses on the child learning to adjust to society's demands, while trying to maintain independence and a sense of self.   These milestones are typical of children in the toddler stages. Some variation is normal. Talk to your health care provider if you have questions about your child's development.   PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT  The following are signs of expected physical development in a toddler:  GROSS MOTOR SKILLS (use of large muscles in the legs and arms)  - Stands alone well by 12 months  - Walks well by 12 - 15 months (Ifa child is not walking by 18 months, he or she should be evaluated by a health care provider.)  - Learns to walk backwards and up steps with help at about 16 - 18 months  - Jumps in place by about 24 months  - Rides a tricycle and stands briefly on one foot by about 36 months    FINE MOTOR SKILLS (use of small muscles in hands and fingers)  - Makes tower of three cubes by around 15 months  - Scribbles by 15 - 18 months  - Can use spoon by 24 months  - Can copy a circle by 36 months    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT  - Uses 2 - 3 words (other than Mama or Dada) at 12 - 15 months  - Understands and follows simple commands (such as ""bring to Mommy"") at 14 - 16 months  - Names pictures of items and animals at 18 - 24 months  - Points to named body parts at 18 - 24 months  - Begins to say his or her own name at 22 - 24 months  - Combines 2 words at 16 to 24 months (There is a range of ages at which children are first able to combine words into sentences. Talk to your child's health care provider if the toddler cannot make sentences by 24 months.)  - Knows gender and age by 36 months    SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT  - Indicates some needs by pointing at 12 - 15 months  - Looks for help when in trouble by 18 months  - Helps to undress and put things away by 18 - 24 months  - Listens to stories when shown pictures and can tell aboutrecent experiences by 24 months  - Cantake partin pretend play and simple games by 24 - 36 months    BEHAVIOR  Toddlers are always trying to be more independent. This creates safety concerns as well as discipline challenges. The child must be consistently taught the limits of appropriate vs. inappropriate behavior.  When toddlers try out activities they haven't yet mastered, they can get frustrated and angry. Breath-holding, crying, screaming, and temper tantrums may often occur.  It is important for a child at this stage to:  - Learn from experiences  - Rely on boundaries between acceptable and unacceptable behaviors    SAFETY  Toddler safety is very important.  - Parents need to be aware that the child can now walk, run, climb, jump, and explore. This new stage of movement makes child-proofing the home very important. Window guards, gates on stairways, cabinet locks, toilet seat locks, electric outlet covers, and other safety features are needed to keep the child safe.  - Put the toddler in a safety restraint (toddler car seat) when riding in a car.  - Do not leave a toddler unattended for even short periods of time. Remember, more accidents occur during the toddler years than at any other stage of childhood.  - Make clear rules about not playing in streets or crossing without an adult.  - Falls are a major cause of injury. Keep gates or doors to stairways closed, and use guards for all windows above the ground floor. Do not leave chairs or ladders in areas that are likely to tempt the toddler into climbing up to explore new heights. Use corner guards on furniture in areas where the toddler is likely to walk, play, or run.  - Poisoning is a common cause of toddler illness and death. Keep all medicines in a locked cabinet. Keep all toxic household products (polishes, acids, cleaning solutions, chlorine bleach, lighter fluid, insecticides, or poisons) in a locked cabinet or closet. Many household and garden plants, such as toad stools, may cause serious illness or death if eaten. Ask your child's health care provider for a list of common poisonous plants.  - If someone in the household owns a firearm, make sure it is unloaded and locked in a secure place.  - Keep toddlers away from the kitchen with a safety gate, or place them in a playpen or high chair. This will eliminate the danger of burns from pulling hot foods off the stove or bumping into the hot oven door.  - Do not let toddlers play in water alone. A toddler may drown, even in shallow water in a bathtub. Parent-child swimming lessons can be another safe and enjoyable way for toddlers to play in water. Never leave a child unattended near a pool, open toilet, or bathtub. Toddlers cannot learn how to swim and cannot be independent near any body of water.    PARENTING TIPS  - The toddler years are for children to learn accepted rules of behavior. It is important for parents to be consistent both in modeling behavior (behaving the way you want your child to behave), and in pointing out inappropriate behavior in the child. Recognize and reward positive behavior. You can introduce time-outs for negative behavior, or for going beyond the limits you set for your child.  - The toddler's favorite word may seem to be ""NO!!!"" It is important for parents not to fall into a pattern of negative behaviorusing yelling, spanking, and threats.  - Teach children the proper names of body parts.  - Stress the unique, individual qualities of the child.  - Teach the concepts of please, thank you, and sharing with others.  - Read to the child regularly. This will help develop verbal skills.  - Toddlers thrive on regularity. Major changes in their routine are hard for them. Toddlers should have regular nap, bed, snack, and meal times.  - Toddlers should not be allowed to eat many snacks throughout the day. Too many snacks can take away the desire to eat regular meals, which tend to offer more balanced nutrition.   - Traveling with a toddler or having guests at the house can disrupt the childs routine. This may make the child more irritable. In these situations, reassure the child and try to get back to a routine in a calm way.) ",1059,5
Do you have information about Toddler Development,"Mastering new skills such as how to walk, talk, and use the potty are developmental milestones. It is exciting to watch your toddler learn new skills.

What causes Otitis media with effusion ? (Also called: OME; Secretory otitis media; Serous otitis media; Silent otitis media; Silent ear infection; Glue ear),"The Eustachian tube connects the inside of the ear to the back of the throat. This tube helps drain fluid to prevent it from building up in the ear. The fluid drains from the tube and is swallowed.  Otitis media with effusion (OME) and ear infections are connected in two ways:  - After most ear infections have been treated, fluid (an effusion) remains in the middle ear for a few days or weeks.  - When the Eustachian tube is partially blocked, fluid builds up in the middle ear. Bacteria inside the ear become trapped and begin to grow. This may lead to an ear infection.    The following can cause swelling of the Eustachian tube lining that leads to increased fluid:  - Allergies  - Irritants (especially cigarette smoke)  - Respiratory infections    The following can cause the Eustachian tube to close or become blocked:  - Drinking while lying on your back  - Sudden increases in air pressure (such as descending in an airplane or on a mountain road)    Getting water in a baby's ears will not lead to a blocked tube.  OME is most common in winter or early spring, but it can occur at any time of year. It can affect people of any age. It occurs most often in children under age 2, but is rare in newborns.  Younger children get OME more often than older children or adults for several reasons:  - The tube is shorter, more horizontal, and straighter, making it easier for bacteria to enter.  - The tube is floppier, with a tinier opening that's easy to block.  - Young children get more colds because it takes time for the immune system to be able to recognize and ward off cold viruses.    The fluid in OME is often thin and watery. In the past, it was thought that the fluid got thicker the longer it was present in the ear. (""Glue ear"" is a common name given to OME with thick fluid.) However, fluid thickness is now thought to berelated to the ear itself, rather than to how long the fluid is present.) ",1068,2

What are the treatments for Otitis media with effusion ? (Also called: OME; Secretory otitis media; Serous otitis media; Silent otitis media; Silent ear infection; Glue ear),"Most health care providers will not treat OME at first, unless there are also signs of an infection. Instead, they will recheck the problem in 2 to 3 months.  Some children who have had repeat ear infections may receive a small, daily dose of antibiotics to prevent new infections.  You can make the following changes to help clear up the fluid behind the eardrum:  - Avoid cigarette smoke  - Encourage infants to breastfeed  - Treat allergies by staying away from triggers (such as dust). Adults and older children may be given allergy medications.    Most often the fluid will clear on its own. You doctor may suggest watching the condition for a while to see if it is getting worse before recommending treatment.  If the fluid is still present after 6 weeks, the doctor may recommend:  - Continuing to watch the problem  - A hearing test  - A single trial of antibiotics (if they were not given earlier)    If the fluid is still present at 8 to 12 weeks, antibiotics may be tried. These medicines are not always helpful.  At some point, the child's hearing should be tested.  If there is significant hearing loss (more than 20 decibels), antibiotics or ear tubes might be needed.  If the fluid is still present after 4 to 6 months, tubes are probably needed, even if there is no major hearing loss.  Sometimes the adenoids must be taken out for the Eustachian tube to work properly.) ",1071,8

A surgeon may need to clean out (debride) tissue that has gathered inside the ear.  Other surgeries that may be needed include:  - Surgery to clean the infection out of the mastoid bone (mastoidectomy)  - Surgery to repair or replace the small bones in the middle ear  - Repair of the eardrum  - Ear tube surgery) ",1076,0
What is (are) Ear Infections ? (Also called: Otitis media),"Ear infections are the most common reason parents bring their child to a doctor. Three out of four children will have at least one ear infection by their third birthday. Adults can also get ear infections, but they are less common.    The infection usually affects the middle ear and is called otitis media. The tubes inside the ears become clogged with fluid and mucus. This can affect hearing, because sound cannot get through all that fluid.    If your child isn't old enough to say ""My ear hurts,"" here are a few things to look for       - Tugging at ears    - Crying more than usual    - Fluid draining from the ear    - Trouble sleeping    - Balance difficulties    - Hearing problems       Your health care provider will diagnose an ear infection by looking inside the ear with an instrument called an otoscope.    Often, ear infections go away on their own. Your health care provider may recommend pain relievers. Severe infections and infections in young babies may require antibiotics.     Children who get infections often may need surgery to place small tubes inside their ears. The tubes relieve pressure in the ears so that the child can hear again.

What causes Drug allergies ? (Also called: Allergic reaction - drug (medication); Drug hypersensitivity; Medication hypersensitivity),"Adverse reactions to drugs are common. (adverse means unwanted or unexpected.) Almost any drug can cause an adverse reaction. Reactions range from irritating or mild side effects such as nausea and vomiting to life-threatening anaphylaxis.  A true drug allergy is caused by a series of chemical steps in the body that produce the allergic reaction to a medication.  The first time you take the medicine, you may have no problems. However, your body's immune system may produce a substance (antibody) called IgE against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the IgE tells your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine, which causes your allergy symptoms. A drug allergy may also occur without your body producing IgE. Instead, it might produce other types of antibodies, or have other reactions that do not produce antibodies.  Most drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. Serum sickness is a delayed type of drug allergy that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medication or vaccine.  Common allergy-causing drugs include:  -  Anticonvulsants   -  Insulin (especially animal sources of insulin)   -  Iodinated (containing iodine) x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like reactions)   -  Penicillin and related antibiotics   -  Sulfa drugs    Most side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction. For example, aspirin can cause nonallergic hives or trigger asthma. Some drug reactions are considered idiosyncratic. This means the reaction is an unusual effect of the medication. It is not due to a known chemical effect of the drug. Many people confuse an uncomfortable, but not serious, side effect of a medicine (such as nausea) with a true drug allergy.) ",1079,2

How should Phentermine and Topiramate be used and what is the dosage ?,"Phentermine and topiramate come as extended-release capsules to take by mouth. The medication is usually taken with or without food once a day in the morning. This medication may cause difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep if it is taken in the evening. Take phentermine and topiramate at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take phentermine and topiramate exactly as directed.  Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of phentermine and topiramate and increase your dose after 14 days. After you take this dose for 12 weeks, your doctor will check to see how much weight you have lost. If you have not lost a certain amount of weight, your doctor may tell you to stop taking phentermine and topiramate or may increase your dose and then increase it again after 14 days. After you take the new dose for 12 weeks, your doctor will check to see how much weight you have lost. If you have not lost a certain amount of weight, it is not likely that you will benefit from taking phentermine and topiramate, so your doctor will probably tell you to stop taking the medication.  Phentermine and topiramate may be habit forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor.  Phentermine and topiramate will help control your weight only as long as you continue to take the medication. Do not stop taking phentermine and topiramate without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking phentermine and topiramate, you may experience seizures. Your doctor will tell you how to decrease your dose gradually.  Phentermine and topiramate is not available at retail pharmacies. This medication is available only through specific mail order pharmacies.

What is (are) Dementia - home care ? (Also called: Caring for someone with dementia; Home care - dementia),"A loved one with dementia will need support in the home as the disease gets worse. You can help by trying to understand how the person with dementia perceives his or her world. Give the person a chance to talk about any challenges and take part in his or her own daily care.  Start by talking with your loved one's health care provider. Ask how you can:  - Help the person stay calm and oriented  - Make dressing and grooming easier  - Talk to the person  - Help with memory loss  - Manage behavior and sleep problems   Tips for reducing confusion in people with dementia include:  - Have familiar objects and people around.  - Keep lights on at night.  - Use reminders, notes, lists of routine tasks, or directions for daily activities.  - Stick to a simple activity schedule.    Taking regular walks with a caregiver can help improve communication skills and prevent wandering.  Calming music may reduce wandering and restlessness, ease anxiety, and improve sleep and behavior.  People with dementia should have their eyes and ears checked. If problems are found, hearing aids, glasses, or cataract surgery may be needed.  People with dementia should also have regular driving tests. At some point, it won't be safe for them to continue to drive. This may not be an easy conversation, so seek help from their provider and other family members. State laws vary on the ability of a person with dementia to continue to drive.  Supervised meals can help with feeding. People with dementia often forget to eat and drink, and can become dehydrated as a result. Talk to the provider about the need for extra calories due to increased physical activity from restlessness and wandering.  Also talk to the provider about:  - Watching for risk of choking and what to do if choking occurs  - How to increase safety in the home  - How to prevent falls  - Ways to improve bathroom safety    The Alzheimer's Association's Safe Return Program requires people with dementia to wear an identification bracelet. If they wander, their caregiver can contact the police and the national Safe Return office, where information about them is stored and shared nationwide.  Eventually, people with dementia may need 24-hour monitoring and assistance to provide a safe environment, control aggressive or agitated behavior, and meet their needs.  LONG-TERM CARE  A person with dementia may need monitoring and help at home or in an institution. Possible options include:  - Adult day care  - Boarding homes  - Nursing homes  - In-home care    Many organizations are available to help you care for a person with dementia. They include:  - Adult protective services  - Community resources  - Local or state government departments of aging  - Visiting nurses or aides  - Volunteer services    In some communities, dementia-related support groups may be available. Family counseling can help family members cope with home care.  Advance directives, power of attorney, and other legal actions may make it easier to decide on care for the person with dementia. Seek legal advice early, before the person is unable to make these decisions.  There are support groups that can provide information and resources for people with Alzheimer disease and their caregivers.) ",1130,4

Although the condition can affect people of all ages, it generally occurs in older people (the median age of diagnosis is between 60 and 67 years). Signs and symptoms include prolonged bleeding, frequent nosebleeds, bruising throughout the body, solid swellings of congealed blood (hematomas), hematuria, and gastrointestinal or urologic bleeding. Acquired hemophilia occurs when the body's immune system attacks and disables a certain protein that helps the blood clot. About half of the cases are associated with other conditions, such as pregnancy, autoimmune disease, cancer, skin diseases, or allergic reactions to medications. Treatment is aimed at controlling bleeding episodes and addressing the underlying cause of the condition.) ",1131,0

The degree of intellectual disability varies from mild to moderate. People with Down syndrome may also be born with various health concerns such as heart defects or digestive abnormalities. They also have an increased risk to develop gastroesophageal reflux, celiac disease, hypothyroidism, hearing and vision problems, leukemia, and Alzheimer disease. Down syndrome is caused by having three copies of chromosome 21 (called trisomy 21) instead of the usual two copies and is typically not inherited. Treatment focuses on the specific symptoms in each person.) ",1133,10
What are the symptoms of Down syndrome ? (Also called: Trisomy 21; Down's syndrome),"What are the signs and symptoms of Down syndrome? People with Down syndrome may develop the following medical problems:  Congenital hypothyroidism Hearing loss Congenital heart defects Seizures Vision disorders Decreased muscle tone (hypotonia) Children with Down syndrome are also more likely to develop chronic respiratory infections, middle ear infections, and recurrent tonsillitis. In addition, there is a higher incidence of pneumonia in children with Down syndrome than in the general population. Children with Down syndrome have developmental delay. They are often slow to turn over, sit, and stand. Developmental delay may be related to the child's weak muscle tone. Development of speech and language may also take longer than expected. Children with Down syndrome may take longer than other children to reach their developmental milestones, but many of these milestones will eventually be met. Adults with Down syndrome have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer disease, a brain disorder that results in a gradual loss of memory, judgment, and ability to function. Although Alzheimer disease is usually a disorder that occurs in older adults, about half of adults with Down syndrome develop this condition by age 50. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Down syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Acute megakaryocytic leukemia - Aganglionic megacolon - Anal atresia - Atlantoaxial instability - Brachycephaly - Broad palm - Brushfield spots - Complete atrioventricular canal defect - Conductive hearing impairment - Duodenal stenosis - Epicanthus - Flat face - Hypoplastic iliac wing - Hypothyroidism - Intellectual disability - Joint laxity - Macroglossia - Malar flattening - Microtia - Muscular hypotonia - Myeloproliferative disorder - Protruding tongue - Shallow acetabular fossae - Short middle phalanx of the 5th finger - Short palm - Short stature - Single transverse palmar crease - Sporadic - Thickened nuchal skin fold - Upslanted palpebral fissure - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.) ",1134,8
What causes Down syndrome ? (Also called: Trisomy 21; Down's syndrome),"What causes Down syndrome? There are 3 possible genetic causes of Down syndrome: Trisomy 21. Most often, Down syndrome is caused by an extra chromosome 21 in all cells of the affected person.  In these cases, the chromosome 21 pair fails to separate during the formation of an egg (or sperm); this is called ""nondisjunction."" When the egg with 2 copies of chromosome 21 unites with a normal sperm with one copy of chromosome 21 to form an embryo, the resulting embryo has 3 copies of chromosome 21 instead of the normal two. The extra chromosome is then copied in every cell of the baby's body, causing the features of Down syndrome. The cause of nondisjunction is unknown, but research has shown that it happens more often as women age. Nondisjunction is not known to be caused by anything in the environment or anything that parents do (or don't do) before or during pregnancy. Mosaic trisomy 21. In about 1-2% of cases, only some of the cells in a person's body have an extra chromosome 21; this is called ""mosaic trisomy 21"".  In this situation, the fertilized egg may have the right number of chromosomes, but due to a cell division error early in the development of the embryo, some cells ""acquire"" an extra chromosome 21. A person with mosaic trisomy 21 typically has 46 chromosomes in some cells, and 47 chromosomes (with the extra chromosome 21) in others. The features and severity in people with mosaic trisomy 21 may vary widely.  Translocation trisomy 21. About 3-4% of people with Down syndrome have cells that contain 46 chromosomes; however, there is extra chromosome 21 material attached (translocated ) onto another chromosome.  For parents of a child with Down syndrome due to a translocation, there may be an increased chance of Down syndrome in future pregnancies. This is because one of the two parents may be a carrier of a balanced translocation. However, not all parents of people with translocation trisomy 21 have a translocation. Regardless of the type of Down syndrome a person has, all people with Down syndrome have an extra, critical portion of chromosome 21 present in all or some of their cells. This extra genetic material disrupts the normal course of development, causing the characteristic features of Down syndrome.) ",1135,7
"What are the genetic changes related to Down syndrome ? (Also called: 47,XX,+21; 47,XY,+21; Down's syndrome; trisomy 21; trisomy G)","Most cases of Down syndrome result from trisomy 21, which means each cell in the body has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two copies.  Less commonly, Down syndrome occurs when part of chromosome 21 becomes attached (translocated) to another chromosome during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) in a parent or very early in fetal development. Affected people have two normal copies of chromosome 21 plus extra material from chromosome 21 attached to another chromosome, resulting in three copies of genetic material from chromosome 21. Affected individuals with this genetic change are said to have translocation Down syndrome.  A very small percentage of people with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21 in only some of the body's cells. In these people, the condition is called mosaic Down syndrome.  Researchers believe that having extra copies of genes on chromosome 21 disrupts the course of normal development, causing the characteristic features of Down syndrome and the increased risk of health problems associated with this condition.) ",1136,7
"Is Down syndrome inherited ? (Also called: 47,XX,+21; 47,XY,+21; Down's syndrome; trisomy 21; trisomy G)","Most cases of Down syndrome are not inherited. When the condition is caused by trisomy 21, the chromosomal abnormality occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells in a parent. The abnormality usually occurs in egg cells, but it occasionally occurs in sperm cells. An error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes. For example, an egg or sperm cell may gain an extra copy of chromosome 21. If one of these atypical reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have an extra chromosome 21 in each of the body's cells.  People with translocation Down syndrome can inherit the condition from an unaffected parent. The parent carries a rearrangement of genetic material between chromosome 21 and another chromosome. This rearrangement is called a balanced translocation. No genetic material is gained or lost in a balanced translocation, so these chromosomal changes usually do not cause any health problems. However, as this translocation is passed to the next generation, it can become unbalanced. People who inherit an unbalanced translocation involving chromosome 21 may have extra genetic material from chromosome 21, which causes Down syndrome.  Like trisomy 21, mosaic Down syndrome is not inherited. It occurs as a random event during cell division early in fetal development. As a result, some of the body's cells have the usual two copies of chromosome 21, and other cells have three copies of this chromosome.) ",1137,7

MID usually affects people between ages 55 and 75. More men than women have vascular dementia.  Vascular dementia is caused by a series of small strokes.  - A stroke is an interruption in or blockage of the blood supply to any part of the brain. A stroke is also called an infarct. Multi-infarct means that more than one area in the brain has been injured due to a lack of blood.  - If blood flow is stopped for longer than a few seconds, the brain cannot get oxygen. Brain cells can die, causing permanent damage.  - When these strokes affect a small area, there may be no symptoms of a stroke. These are called silent strokes. Over time, as more areas of the brain are damaged, the symptoms of dementia appear.  - Not all strokes are silent. Larger strokes that affect strength, sensation, or other brain and nervous system (neurologic) function can also lead to dementia.    Risk factors for vascular dementia include:  - Diabetes  - Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis)  - High blood pressure (hypertension)  - Smoking  - Stroke   Symptoms of dementia may also be caused by other types of disorders of the brain.

What is (are) Dementia ?,"Dementia is not a specific disease. It is a descriptive term for a collection of symptoms that can be caused by a number of disorders that affect the brain. People with dementia have significantly impaired intellectual functioning that interferes with normal activities and relationships. They also lose their ability to solve problems and maintain emotional control, and they may experience personality changes and behavioral problems, such as agitation, delusions, and hallucinations. While memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, memory loss by itself does not mean that a person has dementia. Doctors diagnose dementia only if two or more brain functions - such as memory and language skills -- are significantly impaired without loss of consciousness. Some of the diseases that can cause symptoms of dementia are Alzheimers disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntingtons disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Doctors have identified other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms including reactions to medications, metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities, nutritional deficiencies, infections, poisoning, brain tumors, anoxia or hypoxia (conditions in which the brains oxygen supply is either reduced or cut off entirely), and heart and lung problems.

What causes Pediatric sleep apnea ? (Also called: Sleep apnea - pediatric; Apnea - pediatric sleep apnea syndrome; Sleep-disordered breathing - pediatric),"During sleep, all of the muscles in the body become more relaxed. This includes the muscles that help keep the throat open so air can flow into the lungs.  Normally, the throat remains open enough during sleep to let air pass by. However, some children have a narrow throat. This is often this is because of large tonsils or adenoids, which partially block the airflow. When the muscles in their upper throat relax during sleep, the tissues close in and block the airway. This stop in breathing is called apnea.  Other factors that also may increase the risk of sleep apnea in children include:  - A small jaw  - Certain shapes of the roof of the mouth (palate)   - Large tongue, which may fall back and block the airway  - Obesity  - Poor muscle tone due to conditions such as Down syndrome or cerebral palsy) ",1153,6

What is (are) Central sleep apnea ? (Also called: Sleep apnea - central),Central sleep apnea is a sleep disorder in which breathing stops over and over during sleep.) ,1158,1
What causes Central sleep apnea ? (Also called: Sleep apnea - central),"Central sleep apnea results when the brain temporarily stops sending signals to the muscles that control breathing.   The condition often occurs in people who have certain medical problems. For example, it can develop insomeone who hasa problem with the brainstem, which controls breathing.  Conditions that can cause or lead to central sleep apnea include:  - Problems that affect the brainstem (the brainstem controls breathing) including brain infection, stroke, or conditions of the cervical spine (neck)  - Parkinson disease  - Obesity  - Certain medicines,such as narcotic painkillers  - Heart failure   If the apnea is not associated with another disease, it is called idiopathic central sleep apnea.  A condition called Cheyne-Stokes respiration can mimic central sleep apnea. This involves breathing to a variable depth, usually while sleeping.  Central sleep apnea is not the same as obstructive sleep apnea. With obstructive sleep apnea, breathing stops and starts because the airway is narrowed or blocked. But a person can have both conditions, such as with a medical problem called obesity hypoventilation syndrome.) ",1159,1
What are the treatments for Pediatric sleep apnea ? (Also called: Sleep apnea - pediatric; Apnea - pediatric sleep apnea syndrome; Sleep-disordered breathing - pediatric),"Surgery to remove the tonsils and adenoids often cures the condition in children.  If needed, surgery also may be used to:  - Remove extra tissue at the back of the throat  - Correct problems with the structures in the face  - Create an opening in the windpipe to bypass the blocked airway if there are physical problems    Sometimes, surgery is not recommended or does not help. In that case, your child my use a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device.  - The child wears a mask over their nose during sleep.  - The mask is connected by a hose to a small machine that sits at the side of the bed.  - The machine pumps air under pressure through the hose and mask and into the airway during sleep. This helps keep the airway open.    It can take some time to get used to sleeping using CPAP therapy. Good follow-up and support from a sleep center can help your child overcome any problems using CPAP.  Other treatments may include:  - Inhaled nasal steroids.  - Dental device. This is inserted into the mouth during sleep to keep the jaw forward and the airway open.  - Weight loss, for overweight children.) ",1160,4
What is (are) Sleep Apnea ?,Espaol,1161,9
What is (are) Sleep Apnea ?,"Sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder characterized by brief interruptions of breathing during sleep. These episodes usually last 10 seconds or more and occur repeatedly throughout the night. People with sleep apnea will partially awaken as they struggle to breathe, but in the morning they will not be aware of the disturbances in their sleep. The most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), caused by relaxation of soft tissue in the back of the throat that blocks the passage of air. Central sleep apnea (CSA) is caused by irregularities in the brains normal signals to breathe. Most people with sleep apnea will have a combination of both types. The hallmark symptom of the disorder is excessive daytime sleepiness. Additional symptoms of sleep apnea include restless sleep, loud snoring (with periods of silence followed by gasps), falling asleep during the day, morning headaches, trouble concentrating, irritability, forgetfulness, mood or behavior changes, anxiety, and depression. Not everyone who has these symptoms will have sleep apnea, but it is recommended that people who are experiencing even a few of these symptoms visit their doctor for evaluation. Sleep apnea is more likely to occur in men than women, and in people who are overweight or obese.) ",1162,1

What is (are) medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ? (Also called: ACADM deficiency; MCAD deficiency; MCADD; MCADH deficiency; medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency; medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency),"Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is a condition that prevents the body from converting certain fats to energy, particularly during periods without food (fasting).  Signs and symptoms of MCAD deficiency typically appear during infancy or early childhood and can include vomiting, lack of energy (lethargy), and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). In rare cases, symptoms of this disorder are not recognized early in life, and the condition is not diagnosed until adulthood. People with MCAD deficiency are at risk of serious complications such as seizures, breathing difficulties, liver problems, brain damage, coma, and sudden death.  Problems related to MCAD deficiency can be triggered by periods of fasting or by illnesses such as viral infections. This disorder is sometimes mistaken for Reye syndrome, a severe disorder that may develop in children while they appear to be recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or flu. Most cases of Reye syndrome are associated with the use of aspirin during these viral infections.) ",1169,3

What are the genetic changes related to medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ? (Also called: ACADM deficiency; MCAD deficiency; MCADD; MCADH deficiency; medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency; medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency),"Mutations in the ACADM gene cause MCAD deficiency. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, which is required to break down (metabolize) a group of fats called medium-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids are found in foods and the body's fat tissues. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods of fasting, fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.  Mutations in the ACADM gene lead to a shortage (deficiency) of the MCAD enzyme within cells. Without sufficient amounts of this enzyme, medium-chain fatty acids are not metabolized properly. As a result, these fats are not converted to energy, which can lead to the characteristic signs and symptoms of this disorder such as lethargy and hypoglycemia. Medium-chain fatty acids or partially metabolized fatty acids may also build up in tissues and damage the liver and brain. This abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of MCAD deficiency.) ",1171,5

What is (are) autoimmune Addison disease ? (Also called: autoimmune Addison's disease; autoimmune adrenalitis; classic Addison disease; primary Addison disease),"Autoimmune Addison disease affects the function of the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. It is classified as an autoimmune disorder because it results from a malfunctioning immune system that attacks the adrenal glands. As a result, the production of several hormones is disrupted, which affects many body systems.  The signs and symptoms of autoimmune Addison disease can begin at any time, although they most commonly begin between ages 30 and 50. Common features of this condition include extreme tiredness (fatigue), nausea, decreased appetite, and weight loss. In addition, many affected individuals have low blood pressure (hypotension), which can lead to dizziness when standing up quickly; muscle cramps; and a craving for salty foods. A characteristic feature of autoimmune Addison disease is abnormally dark areas of skin (hyperpigmentation), especially in regions that experience a lot of friction, such as the armpits, elbows, knuckles, and palm creases. The lips and the inside lining of the mouth can also be unusually dark. Because of an imbalance of hormones involved in development of sexual characteristics, women with this condition may lose their underarm and pubic hair.  Other signs and symptoms of autoimmune Addison disease include low levels of sugar (hypoglycemia) and sodium (hyponatremia) and high levels of potassium (hyperkalemia) in the blood. Affected individuals may also have a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) and an increase in the number of white blood cells (lymphocytosis), particularly those known as eosinophils (eosinophilia).  Autoimmune Addison disease can lead to a life-threatening adrenal crisis, characterized by vomiting, abdominal pain, back or leg cramps, and severe hypotension leading to shock. The adrenal crisis is often triggered by a stressor, such as surgery, trauma, or infection.  Individuals with autoimmune Addison disease or their family members often have another autoimmune disorder, most commonly autoimmune thyroid disease or type 1 diabetes.) ",1197,4
How many people are affected by autoimmune Addison disease ?

What are the genetic changes related to autoimmune Addison disease ? (Also called: autoimmune Addison's disease; autoimmune adrenalitis; classic Addison disease; primary Addison disease),"The cause of autoimmune Addison disease is complex and not completely understood. A combination of environmental and genetic factors plays a role in the disorder, and changes in multiple genes are thought to affect the risk of developing the condition.  The genes that have been associated with autoimmune Addison disease participate in the body's immune response. The most commonly associated genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). Each HLA gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. The most well-known risk factor for autoimmune Addison disease is a variant of the HLA-DRB1 gene called HLA-DRB1*04:04. This and other disease-associated HLA gene variants likely contribute to an inappropriate immune response that leads to autoimmune Addison disease, although the mechanism is unknown.  Normally, the immune system responds only to proteins made by foreign invaders, not to the body's own proteins. In autoimmune Addison disease, however, an immune response is triggered by a normal adrenal gland protein, typically a protein called 21-hydroxylase. This protein plays a key role in producing certain hormones in the adrenal glands. The prolonged immune attack triggered by 21-hydroxylase damages the adrenal glands (specifically the outer layers of the glands known, collectively, as the adrenal cortex), preventing hormone production. A shortage of adrenal hormones (adrenal insufficiency) disrupts several normal functions in the body, leading to hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypotension, muscle cramps, skin hyperpigmentation and other features of autoimmune Addison disease.  Rarely, Addison disease is not caused by an autoimmune reaction. Other causes include infections that damage the adrenal glands, such as tuberculosis, or tumors in the adrenal glands. Addison disease can also be one of several features of other genetic conditions, including X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and autoimmune polyglandular syndrome, type 1, which are caused by mutations in other genes.)

It almost always includes steroids taken by mouth. Additional specialists in infectious disease or autoimmunity may be needed for diseases such as syphilis, tuberculosis, AIDS, sarcoidosis, or Behcet syndrome.  If the uveitis is caused by a body-wide infection, treatment may involve antibiotics and powerful anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids. See autoimmune disorders for informationabout treating such diseases.) ",1204,3

What is (are) Autoimmune Diseases ?,"Your body's immune system protects you from disease and infection. But if you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. Autoimmune diseases can affect many parts of the body.    No one is sure what causes autoimmune diseases. They do tend to run in families. Women - particularly African-American, Hispanic-American, and Native-American women - have a higher risk for some autoimmune diseases.    There are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases, and some have similar symptoms. This makes it hard for your health care provider to know if you really have one of these diseases, and if so, which one. Getting a diagnosis can be frustrating and stressful. Often, the first symptoms are fatigue, muscle aches and a low fever. The classic sign of an autoimmune disease is inflammation, which can cause redness, heat, pain and swelling.    The diseases may also have flare-ups, when they get worse, and remissions, when symptoms get better or disappear. Treatment depends on the disease, but in most cases one important goal is to reduce inflammation. Sometimes doctors prescribe corticosteroids or other drugs that reduce your immune response.)

What is (are) Uveitis ? (Also called: Iritis; Pars planitis; Choroiditis; Chorioretinitis; Anterior uveitis; Posterior uveitis),"Uveitis is swelling and irritation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye. The uvea provides most of the blood supply to the retina.) ",1210,6
What causes Uveitis ? (Also called: Iritis; Pars planitis; Choroiditis; Chorioretinitis; Anterior uveitis; Posterior uveitis),"Uveitis can be caused by autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis. It can also be caused byinfection or exposure to toxins. In many cases, the cause is unknown.  The most common form of uveitis is anterior uveitis. This involves inflammation in the front part of the eye. It is often called iritis because it usually only affects the iris, the colored part of the eye. The inflammation may be linked with autoimmune diseases, but most cases occur in healthy people. The disorder may affect only one eye. It is most common in young and middle-aged people.  Posterior uveitis affects the back part of the uvea. It involves primarily the choroid, which is a layer of blood vessels and connective tissue in the middle part of the eye. This type of uveitis is called choroiditis. If the retina is also involved, it is called chorioretinitis. You may develop this condition if you have had a body-wide (systemic) infection or if you have an autoimmune disease.  Another form of uveitis is pars planitis. This inflammation affects the narrowed area (pars plana) between the colored part of the eye (iris) and the choroid. Pars planitis most often occurs in young men. It is generally not associated with any other disease. However, it may be linked to Crohn's disease and possibly multiple sclerosis.  Uveitis can be associated with any of the following:  - AIDS  - Ankylosing spondylitis  - Behcet syndrome  - CMV retinitis  - Herpes zoster infection  - Histoplasmosis  - Injury  - Kawasaki disease  - Psoriasis  - Reactive arthritis  - Rheumatoid arthritis  - Sarcoidosis  - Syphilis  - Toxoplasmosis  - Tuberculosis  - Ulcerative colitis) ",1211,4

The surgery is only one part of a complex, long-term process.  Several experts will help you prepare for the procedure, and make sure you are comfortable before, during, and after surgery.) ",1224,4
What is (are) Transplant services ?,"Transplant surgery is typically done to replace a diseased body part with a healthy one.  SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANTS  - Auto islet cell transplant is done after a person has their pancreas removed due to chronic pancreatitis. The procedure takes insulin-producing cells from the pancreas and returns them to the patient's body.  - Corneal transplant replaces a damaged or diseased cornea. The cornea is the clear tissue on the front of the eye that helps focus light on the retina. It is the part of the eye on which a contact lens rests.  - Heart transplant is an option for someone with congestive heart failure that has not responded to medical treatment.  - Intestinal transplant is an option for patients with short bowel or short gut syndrome or advanced liver disease, or who must receive all nutrients through a feeding line. See: Total parenteral nutrition (TPN)  - Kidney transplant is an option for someone with chronic kidney failure. It may be donewith a kidney-pancreas transplant.  - Liver transplant may be the only option for someone with liver disease that has led to liver failure.  - Lung transplant may replace one or both lungs. It may be the only option for someone with lung disease who has not gotten better using other medicines and therapies, and is expected to survive for less than 2 years.    BLOOD/BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTS (STEM CELL TRANSPLANTS)  You may need a stem cell transplant if you have a disease that damages the cells in bone marrow, or if you received high doses of chemotherapy or radiation.  Depending on the type of transplant, your procedure may be called a bone marrow transplant, a cord blood transplant, or a peripheral blood stem cell transplant. All three use stem cells, which are immature cells that give rise to all blood cells. Stem cell transplants are similar to blood transfusions and generally do not need surgery.  There are two different types of transplants:  - Autologous transplants use your own blood cells or bone marrow.  - Allogeneic transplants use a donor's blood cells or bone marrow. A syngeneic allogenic transplant uses cells or bone marrow from the patient's identical twin.    For more information, see: Bone marrow transplant  THE TRANSPLANT SERVICES TEAM  The transplant services team includes carefully selected experts, including:  - Surgeons who specialize in performing organ transplants  - Medical doctors  - Radiologists and medical imaging technologists  - Nurses  - Infectious disease experts  - Physical therapists  - Psychiatrists, psychologists, and other counselors  - Social workers  - Nutritionists and dietitians    BEFORE A TRANSPLANT  You will have a complete medical exam to identify and treat all medical problems, such as kidney and heart disease.  The transplant team will evaluate you and review your medical history to determine if you meet the criteria for organ transplantation. Most types of organ transplants have guidelines detailing what type of patient is most likely to benefit from a transplant and will be able to manage the challenging process.  If the transplant team believes you are a good candidate for a transplant, you will be put on a national waiting list. Your place on a waiting list is based on a number of factors, which depend on the type of transplant you are receiving.   Once you are on the waiting list, the search for a matching donor begins. Types of donors depend on your specific transplant, but include:  - A living related donor is related to you, such as a parent, sibling, or child.  - A living unrelated donor is a person, such as a friend or spouse.  - A deceased donor is someone who has recently died. The heart, liver, kidneys, lungs, intestines, and pancreas can be recovered from an organ donor.    After donating an organ, living donors can live a normal, healthy life.   You should identify family, friends, or other caregivers who can offer help and support during and after the transplant process.  You will also want to prepare your home to make it comfortable for when you return after being released from the hospital.  AFTER A TRANSPLANT  How long you stay in the hospital depends on the type of transplant that you have. During your time in the hospital, you will be seen daily by the transplant services team.  Your transplant services coordinators will arrange for your discharge. They will discuss with you plans for care at home, transportation to clinic visits, and housing, if needed.  You will be told how to take care of yourself after the transplant. This will include information about:  - Medications  - How often you need to visit the doctor or clinic  - What daily activities are allowed or off-limits    After leaving the hospital, you will return home.  You will have periodic follow-ups with the transplant team, as well as with your primary care doctor and any other specialists that may be recommended. The transplant services team will be available to answer any questions that you may have.) ",1225,4
What is (are) Urinary incontinence ? (Also called: Loss of bladder control; Uncontrollable urination; Urination - uncontrollable; Incontinence - urinary),"Urinary (or bladder) incontinence happens when you are not able to keep urine from leaking out of your urethra. The urethra is the tube that carries urine out of your body from your bladder. You may leak urine from time to time. Or, you may not be able to hold any urine.  The three main types of urinary incontinence are:  - Stress incontinence -- occurs during activities like coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercise.  - Urge incontinence -- involves a strong, sudden need to urinate. Then the bladder squeezes and you lose urine. You don't have enough time after you feel the need to urinate to get to the bathroom before you do urinate.  - Overflow incontinence -- occurs when the bladder cannot empty. This leads to dribbling.    Mixed incontinence occurs when you have more than one type of urinary incontinence.  Bowel incontinence is when you are unable to control the passage of stool. It is not covered in this article.) ",1226,2
What causes Urinary incontinence ? (Also called: Loss of bladder control; Uncontrollable urination; Urination - uncontrollable; Incontinence - urinary),"Causes of urinary incontinence include:  - Blockage in the urinary system  - Brain or nerve problems  - Dementia or other mental health problems that make it hard to feel and respond to the urge to urinate  - Problems with the urinary system  - Nerve and muscle problems    Incontinence may be sudden and go away after a short period of time. Or, it may continue long-term. Causes of sudden or temporary incontinence include:  - Bedrest -- for example, when recovering from surgery  - Certain medications (such as diuretics, antidepressants, tranquilizers, some cough and cold remedies, and antihistamines)  - Mental confusion  - Pregnancy  - Prostate infection or inflammation  - Stool impaction from severe constipation, which causes pressure on the bladder  - Urinary tract infection or inflammation  - Weight gain    Causes that may be more long-term:  - Alzheimer's disease  - Bladder cancer  - Bladder spasms  - Depression  - Large prostate in men  - Nervous system conditions, such as multiple sclerosis or stroke  - Nerve or muscle damage after radiation treatment to the pelvis  - Pelvic prolapse in women -- falling or sliding of the bladder, urethra, or rectum into the vagina. This may be caused by pregnancy and delivery.  - Problems with the urinary tract  - Spinal cord injuries  - Weakness of the sphincter, the circle-shaped muscles that open and close the bladder. This can be caused by prostate surgery in men, or surgery to the vagina in women.) ",1227,0
What to do for Urinary incontinence ? (Also called: Loss of bladder control; Uncontrollable urination; Urination - uncontrollable; Incontinence - urinary),"If you have symptoms of incontinence, see your health care provider for tests and a treatment plan. Which treatment you get depends on what caused your incontinence and what type you have.  There are four main treatment approaches for urinary incontinence:  Lifestyle changes. These changes may help improve incontinence. You may need to make these changes along with other treatments.  - Keep your bowel movements regular to avoid constipation. Try increasing the fiber in your diet.  - Quit smoking to reduce coughing and bladder irritation. Smoking also increases your risk for bladder cancer.  - Avoid alcohol and caffeinated drinks such as coffee, which can stimulate your bladder.  - Lose weight if you need to.  - Avoid foods and drinks that may irritate your bladder. These include spicy foods, carbonated drinks, and citrus fruits and juices.  - If you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar under good control.    For urine leaks, wear absorbent pads or undergarments. There are many well-designed products no one else will notice.  Bladder training and pelvic floor exercises. Bladder retraining helps you gain better control over your bladder. Kegel exercises can help strengthen the muscles of your pelvic floor. Your provider can show you how to do them. Many women do not do these exercises correctly, even if they believe they are doing them correctly. Often, people benefit from formal bladder strengthening and retraining with a pelvic floor specialist.  Medicines. Depending on the type of incontinence you have, your health care provider may prescribe one or more medicines. These drugs help prevent muscle spasms, relax the bladder, and improve bladder function. Your provider can help you learn how to take these medicines and manage their side effects.  Surgery. If other treatments do not work, or you have severe incontinence, your provider may recommend surgery. The type of surgery you have will depend on:  - The type of incontinence you have (such as urge, stress, or overflow)  - How severe your symptoms are  - The cause (such as pelvic prolapse, enlarged prostate, enlarged uterus, or other causes)    If you have overflow incontinence or you cannot fully empty your bladder, you may need to use a catheter. You may use a catheter that stays in long term, or one that you are taught to put in and take out yourself.) ",1228,2
Do I need to see a doctor for Urinary incontinence ? (Also called: Loss of bladder control; Uncontrollable urination; Urination - uncontrollable; Incontinence - urinary),"Talk to your health care provider about incontinence. Health care providers who treat incontinence are called gynecologists and urologists. They can find the cause and recommend treatments.  Call your local emergency number (such as 911) or go to an emergency room if you suddenly lose control over urine and you have:  - Difficulty talking, walking, or speaking  - Sudden weakness, numbness, or tingling in an arm or leg  - Loss of vision  - Loss of consciousness or confusion  - Loss of bowel control    Call your health care provider if you have:  - Cloudy or bloody urine  - Dribbling  - Frequent or urgent need to urinate  - Pain or burning when you urinate  - Trouble starting your urine flow  - Fever) ",1229,2
What is (are) bladder cancer ? (Also called: Cancer of the bladder; Malignant tumor of urinary bladder; Urinary bladder cancer),"Bladder cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the bladder become abnormal and multiply without control or order. The bladder is a hollow, muscular organ in the lower abdomen that stores urine until it is ready to be excreted from the body. The most common type of bladder cancer begins in cells lining the inside of the bladder and is called transitional cell carcinoma (TCC).  Bladder cancer may cause blood in the urine, pain during urination, frequent urination, or the feeling that one needs to urinate without results. These signs and symptoms are not specific to bladder cancer, however. They also can be caused by noncancerous conditions such as infections.) ",1230,2
What are the genetic changes related to bladder cancer ? (Also called: Cancer of the bladder; Malignant tumor of urinary bladder; Urinary bladder cancer),"As with most cancers, the exact causes of bladder cancer are not known; however, many risk factors are associated with this disease. Many of the major risk factors are environmental, such as smoking and exposure to certain industrial chemicals. Studies suggest that chronic bladder inflammation, a parasitic infection called schistosomiasis, and some medications used to treat cancer are other environmental risk factors associated with bladder cancer.  Genetic factors are also likely to play an important role in determining bladder cancer risk. Researchers have studied the effects of mutations in several genes, including FGFR3, RB1, HRAS, TP53, and TSC1, on the formation and growth of bladder tumors. Each of these genes plays a critical role in regulating cell division by preventing cells from dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Alterations in these genes may help explain why some bladder cancers grow and spread more rapidly than others.  Deletions of part or all of chromosome 9 are common events in bladder tumors. Researchers believe that several genes that control cell growth and division are probably located on chromosome 9. They are working to determine whether a loss of these genes plays a role in the development and progression of bladder cancer.  Most of the genetic changes associated with bladder cancer develop in bladder tissue during a person's lifetime, rather than being inherited from a parent. Some people, however, appear to inherit a reduced ability to break down certain chemicals, which makes them more sensitive to the cancer-causing effects of tobacco smoke and industrial chemicals.) ",1231,2
Is bladder cancer inherited ? (Also called: Cancer of the bladder; Malignant tumor of urinary bladder; Urinary bladder cancer),"Bladder cancer is typically not inherited. Most often, tumors result from genetic mutations that occur in bladder cells during a person's lifetime. These noninherited genetic changes are called somatic mutations.) ",1232,7

They answer emergency calls and give basic medical care. Some EMTs are paramedics - they have training to do medical procedures on site. They usually take you to the ER for more care.    If you or someone you know needs emergency care, go to your hospital's emergency room. If you think the problem is life threatening, call 9-1-1.) ",1233,9
Do you have information about Urine and Urination,"Your kidneys make urine by filtering wastes and extra water from your blood. The waste is called urea. Your blood carries it to the kidneys. From the kidneys, urine travels down two thin tubes called ureters to the bladder. The bladder stores urine until you are ready to urinate. It swells into a round shape when it is full and gets smaller when empty. If your urinary system is healthy, your bladder can hold up to 16 ounces (2 cups) of urine comfortably for 2 to 5 hours.    You may have problems with urination if you have       - Kidney failure    - Urinary tract infections     - An enlarged prostate    - Bladder control problems like incontinence, overactive bladder, or interstitial cystitis    - A blockage that prevents you from emptying your bladder        Some conditions may also cause you to have blood or protein in your urine. If you have a urinary problem, see your healthcare provider. Urinalysis and other urine tests can help to diagnose the problem. Treatment depends on the cause.

Puberty is often late in these children.  These children continue to grow after most of their peers have stopped. Most of the time, they will reach an adult height similar to their parents' height. However, other causes of growth delay must be ruled out.  Genetics may also play a role. One or both parents may be short. Short but healthy parents may have a healthy child who is in the shortest 5% for his or her age. These children are short, but they should reach the height of one or both of their parents.

What causes High Blood Pressure ?,"Changes in Body Functions Researchers continue to study how various changes in normal body functions cause high blood pressure. The key functions affected in high blood pressure include -  kidney fluid and salt balances  -  the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system   - the sympathetic nervous system activity   - blood vessel structure and function. kidney fluid and salt balances the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system the sympathetic nervous system activity blood vessel structure and function. Kidney Fluid and Salt Balances The kidneys normally regulate the bodys salt balance by retaining sodium and water and eliminating potassium. Imbalances in this kidney function can expand blood volumes, which can cause high blood pressure. Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system makes angiotensin and aldosterone hormones. Angiotensin narrows or constricts blood vessels, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure. Aldosterone controls how the kidneys balance fluid and salt levels. Increased aldosterone levels or activity may change this kidney function, leading to increased blood volumes and high blood pressure. Sympathetic Nervous System Activity The sympathetic nervous system has important functions in blood pressure regulation, including heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate. Researchers are investigating whether imbalances in this system cause high blood pressure. Blood Vessel Structure and Function Changes in the structure and function of small and large arteries may contribute to high blood pressure. The angiotensin pathway and the immune system may stiffen small and large arteries, which can affect blood pressure. Genetic Causes High blood pressure often runs in families. Years of research have identified many genes and other mutations associated with high blood pressure. However, known genetic factors only account for 2 to 3 percent of all cases. Emerging research suggests that certain DNA changes before birth also may cause the development of high blood pressure later in life. Unhealthy Lifestyle Habits Unhealthy lifestyle habits can cause high blood pressure, including - high sodium intake and sodium sensitivity  - drinking too much alcohol  - lack of physical activity. high sodium intake and sodium sensitivity drinking too much alcohol lack of physical activity. Overweight and Obesity Research studies show that being overweight or obese can increase the resistance in the blood vessels, causing the heart to work harder and leading to high blood pressure. Medicines Prescription medicines such as asthma or hormone therapies (including birth control pills and estrogen) and over-the-counter medicines such as cold relief medicines may cause high blood pressure. This happens because medicines can - change the way your body controls fluid and salt balances  - cause your blood vessels to constrict  -  impact the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, leading to high blood pressure.  change the way your body controls fluid and salt balances cause your blood vessels to constrict impact the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, leading to high blood pressure. Other Causes Other causes of high blood pressure include medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease, sleep apnea, thyroid problems, or certain tumors. These conditions can change the way your body controls fluids, sodium, and hormones in your blood, which leads to secondary high blood pressure.) ",1257,5

Do you have information about Aging changes in the heart and blood vessels (Also called: Heart disease - aging; Atherosclerosis - aging),"Some changes in the heart and blood vessels normally occur with age, but many other changes that are common with aging are due to modifiable factors that, if not treated, can lead to heart disease.  BACKGROUND  The heart has two sides. The right side pumps blood to the lungs to receive oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide. The left side pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body.  Blood flows out of the heart through arteries, which branch out and get smaller and smaller as they go into the tissues. In the tissues, they become tiny capillaries.  Capillaries are where the blood gives up oxygen and nutrients to the tissues, and receives carbon dioxide and wastes back from the tissues. Then, the vessels begin to collect together into larger and larger veins, which return blood to the heart.      Watch this video about:   Blood flow     AGING CHANGES  Heart:  - The heart has a natural pacemaker system that controls the heartbeat. Some of the pathways of this system may develop fibrous tissue and fat deposits. The natural pacemaker (the SA node) loses some of its cells. These changes may result in a slightly slower heart rate.  - A slight increase in the size of the heart, especially the left ventricle, is not uncommon. The heart wall thickens, so the amount of blood that the chamber can hold may actually decrease despite the increased overall heart size. The heart may fill more slowly.  - Heart changes cause the ECG of a normal, healthy older person to be slightly different than the ECG of a healthy younger adult. Abnormal rhythms (arrhythmias), such as atrial fibrillation, are more common in older people. They may be caused by heart disease.  - Normal changes in the heart include deposits of the ""aging pigment,"" lipofuscin. The heart muscle cells degenerate slightly. The valves inside the heart, which control the direction of blood flow, thicken and become stiffer. A heart murmur caused by valve stiffness is fairly common in the elderly.    Blood vessels:  - Receptors called baroreceptors monitor the blood pressure and make changes to help maintain a fairly constant blood pressure when a person changes positions or is doing other activities. The baroreceptors become less sensitive with aging. This may explain why many older people have orthostatic hypotension, a condition in which the blood pressure falls when a person goes from lying or sitting to standing. This causes dizziness because there is less blood flow to the brain.  - The capillary walls thicken slightly. This may cause a slightly slower rate of exchange of nutrients and wastes.  - The main artery from the heart (aorta) becomes thicker, stiffer, and less flexible. This is probably related to changes in the connective tissue of the blood vessel wall. This makes the blood pressure higher and makes the heart work harder, which may lead to thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophy). The other arteries also thicken and stiffen. In general, most elderly people have a moderate increase in blood pressure.    Blood:  - The blood itself changes slightly with age. Normal aging causes a reduction in total body water. As part of this, there is less fluid in the bloodstream, so blood volume decreases.  - The speed with which red blood cells are produced in response to stress or illness is reduced. This creates a slower response to blood loss and anemia.  - Most of the white blood cells stay at the same levels, although certain white blood cells important to immunity (neutrophils) decrease in their number and ability to fight off bacteria. This reduces the ability to resist infection.    EFFECT OF CHANGES  Normally, the heart continues to pump enough blood to supply all parts of the body. However, an older heart may not be able to pump blood as well when you make it work harder.  Some of the things that make your heart work harder are:  - Certain medicines  - Emotional stress  - Physical exertion  - Illness  - Infections  - Injuries    COMMON PROBLEMS  - Angina (chest pain caused by temporarily reduced blood flow to the heart muscle), shortness of breath with exertion, and heart attack can result from coronary artery disease.  - Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) of various types can occur.  - Anemia may occur, possibly related to malnutrition, chronic infections, blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract, or as a complication of other diseases or medicines.  - Arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) is very common. Fatty plaque deposits inside the blood vessels cause them to narrow and totally block blood vessels.  - Congestive heart failure is also very common in the elderly. In people older than 75, congestive heart failure occurs 10 times more often than in younger adults.  - Coronary artery disease is fairly common. It is often a result of arteriosclerosis.  - High blood pressure and orthostatic hypotension are more common with older age. Elderly people on blood pressure medicines need to work with their doctor to find the best way to manage their high blood pressure. This is because too much medicine may cause low blood pressure and could lead to a fall.  - Heart valve diseases are fairly common. Aortic stenosis, or narrowing of the aortic valve, is the most common valve disease in the elderly.  - Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or strokes can occur if blood flow to the brain is disrupted.    Other problems with the heart and blood vessels include the following:  - Blood clots  - Deep vein thrombosis  - Thrombophlebitis  - Peripheral vascular disease, resulting in intermittent pain in the legs when walking (claudication)  - Varicose veins  - Aneurysms may develop in one of the major arteries from the heart or in the brain. Aneurysms are an abnormal widening or ballooning of a part of an artery due to weakness in the wall of the blood vessel. If an aneurysm bursts it may cause bleeding and death.    PREVENTION  - You can help your circulatory system (heart and blood vessels). Heart disease risk factors that you have some control over include high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes, obesity, and smoking.  - Eat a heart-healthy diet with reduced amounts of saturated fat and cholesterol, and control your weight. Follow your health care provider's recommendations for treating high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes. Reduce or stop smoking.  - Men between the ages of 65 to 75 who have ever smoked should be screened for aneurysms in their abdominal aorta.    Get more exercise:  - Exercise may help prevent obesity, and it helps people with diabetes control their blood sugar.  - Exercise may help you maintain your abilities as much as possible, and it reduces stress.  - Moderate exercise is one of the best things you can do to keep your heart, and the rest of your body, healthy. Consult with your provider before beginning a new exercise program. Exercise moderately and within your capabilities, but do it regularly.  - People who exercise usually have less body fat and smoke less than people who do not exercise. They also tend to have fewer blood pressure problems and less heart disease.    Have regular check-ups for your heart:  - Have your blood pressure checked every year. If you have diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other conditions, your blood pressure may need to be monitored more closely.  - If your cholesterol level is normal, have it rechecked every 5 years. If you have diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other conditions, your cholesterol may need to be monitored more closely.  - If you are an older man (between the ages of 65 to 75) and you have a history of smoking, you should be screened for aneurysms in one of the major arteries of the heart.)

Primary brain tumors may be:  - Not cancerous (benign)  - Invasive (spread to nearby areas)  - Cancerous (malignant)    Brain tumors are classified based on:  - The exact site of the tumor  - The type of tissue involved  - Whether it is cancerous    Brain tumors can directly destroy brain cells. They can also indirectly damage cells by pushing on other parts of the brain. This leads to swelling and increased pressure inside the skull.  Tumors can occur at any age. Many tumors are more common at a certain age. In general, brain tumors in children are very rare.  COMMON TUMOR TYPES  Astrocytomas are usually noncancerous, slow-growing tumors. They commonly develop in children ages 5 to 8. Also called low-grade gliomas, these are the most common brain tumors in children.  Medulloblastomas are the most common type of childhood brain cancer. Most medulloblastomas occur before age 10.  Ependymomas are a type of childhood brain tumor that can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). The location and type of ependymoma determine the type of therapy needed to control the tumor.  Brainstem gliomas are very rare tumors that occur almost only in children. The average age at which they develop is about 6. The tumor may grow very large before causing symptoms.) ",1281,3
Do you have information about Exercise and age (Also called: Age and exercise),"It is never too late to start exercising. Exercise has benefits at any age.  Don't worry if you have never exercised, or if you stopped exercising for some reason. Being physically active can help youto keep doingthe things you enjoy and stay independent as you age.

It helps to have a goal. Your goal might be to:  - Manage a health condition  - Reduce stress  - Improve your stamina  - Be able to buy clothes in a smaller size   Your exercise program mayalso be a way for you to socialize. Taking exercise classes or exercising with a friend are both good ways to be social.  You may have a hard time starting an exercise routine. Once you do start, though, you will begin to notice the benefits, including improved sleep and self-esteem.  Exercise and physical activity can also:  - Improve or maintain your strength and fitness  - Make it easier to do the things you want to do  - Help your balance and walking  - Help with feelings of depression or anxiety and improve your mood  - Maintain your thinking skills (cognitive function) as you get older  - Prevent or treat diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, breast and colon cancer, and osteoporosis   Always talk to your health care provider before starting an exercise program.Your provider can suggest exercises and activities that are right for you.  Exercises can be grouped into four main categories, although many exercises fit into more than one category:  AEROBIC EXERCISE   Aerobic exercise increases your breathing and heart rate. These exercises help your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. They may prevent or delay many diseases, such as diabetes, colon and breast cancers, and heart disease.  - Aerobic sports activities include brisk walking, jogging, swimming, biking, climbing, tennis, and basketball  - Aerobic activities you can do every day include dancing, yard work, pushing your grandchild on a swing, and vacuuming   MUSCLE STRENGTH  Improving your muscle strength can help you climb stairs, carry groceries, and stay independent. You can build muscle strength by:  - Lifting weights or using a resistance band  - Performing everyday activities, such as carrying a full laundry basket from the basement, carrying your smaller grandchildren, or lifting things in the garden    BALANCE EXERCISES  Balance exercises help prevent falls, which is a concern for older adults. Many exercises that strengthen the muscles in the legs, hips, and lower back will improve your balance. It is often best to learn balance exercises from a physical therapist before starting on your own.  Balance exercises may include:  - Standing on one foot  - Walking heel-to-toe  - Tai chi  - Standing on tiptoe to reach something on the top shelf  - Walking up and down the stairs    STRETCHING  Stretching can help your body stay flexible. To stay limber:  - Learn shoulder, upper arm, and calf stretches  - Take yoga classes  - Do everyday activities, such as making your bed or bending over to tie your shoes) ",1282,2

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available.

What causes Chickenpox ? (Also called: Varicella; Chicken pox),"Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It is a member of the herpesvirus family. The same virus also causes shingles in adults.  Chickenpox can be spread very easily to others from 1 to 2 days before blisters appear until all the blisters have crusted over. You may get chickenpox:  - From touching the fluids from a chickenpox blister  - If someone with the disease coughs or sneezes near you   Most cases of chickenpox occur in children younger than age 10. The disease is most often mild, although serious complications may occur. Adults and older children get sicker than younger children in most cases.  Children whose mothers have had chickenpox or have received the chickenpox vaccine are not very likely to catch it before they are 1 year old. If they do catch chickenpox, they often have mild cases. This is because antibodies from their mothers' blood help protect them. Children under 1 year old whose mothers have not had chickenpox or the vaccine can get severe chickenpox.  Severe chickenpox symptoms are more common in children whose immune system does not work well.) ",1289,10
How to prevent Chickenpox ? (Also called: Varicella; Chicken pox),"Because chickenpox is airborne and spreads very easily even before the rash appears, it is hard to avoid.  A vaccine to prevent chickenpox is part of a child's routine vaccine schedule.  The vaccine often prevents the chickenpox disease completely or makes the illness very mild.  Talk to your provider if you think your child might be at high risk for complications and might have been exposed. Taking preventive steps right away may be important. Giving the vaccine early after exposure may still reduce the severity of the disease.) ",1290,8

What is (are) Shingles vaccine - what you need to know ?,"What is shingles?  Shingles is a painful skin rash, often with blisters. It is also called Herpes Zoster, or just Zoster.  A shingles rash usually appears on one side of the face or body and lasts from 2 to 4 weeks. Its main symptom is pain, which can be quite severe. Other symptoms of shingles can include fever, headache, chills and upset stomach. Very rarely, a shingles infection can lead to pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness, brain inflammation (encephalitits) or death.  For about 1 person in 5, severe pain can continue even long after the rash clears up. This is called post-herpetic neuralgia.  Shingles is caused by the Varicella Zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox.  Only someone who has had chickenpox -- or, rarely, has gotten chickenpox vaccine -- can get shingles. The virus stays in your body, and can cause shingles many years later.  You can't catch shingles from another person with shingles. However, a person who has never had chickenpox (or chickenpox vaccine) could get chickenpox from someone with shingles. This is not very common.  Shingles is far more common in people 50 years of age and older than in younger people. It is also more common in people whose immune systems are weakened because of a disease such as cancer, or drugs such as steroids or chemotherapy.  At least 1 million people a year in the United States get shingles. Shingles vaccine  A vaccine for shingles was licensed in 2006. In clinical trials, the vaccine reduced the risk of shingles by 50%. It can also reduce pain in people who still get shingles after being vaccinated.  A single dose of shingles vaccine is recommended for adults 60 years of age and older. Some people should not get shingles vaccine or should wait.  A person should not get shingles vaccine who:  - Has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of shingles vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies.  - Has a weakened immune system because of current:        - AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system,    - Treatment with drugs that affect the immune system, such as prolonged use of high-dose steroids,    - Cancer treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy,    - Cancer affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system, such as leukemia or lymphoma.      - Is pregnant, or might be pregnant. Women should not become pregnant until at least 4 weeks after getting shingles vaccine.    Someone with a minor acute illness, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. But anyone with a moderate or severe acute illness should usually wait until they recover before getting the vaccine. This includes anyone with a temperature of 101.3F or higher. What are the risks from shingles vaccine?  A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. However, the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small.  No serious problems have been identified with shingles vaccine.  Mild problems  - Redness, soreness, swelling, or itching at the site of the injection (about 1 person in 3).  - Headache (about 1 person in 70).    Like all vaccines, shingles vaccine is being closely monitored for unusual or severe problems. What if there is a serious reaction?  What should I look for?  - Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes.    Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.   What should I do?  - If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.  - Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the VAERS website or by calling 1-800-822-7967.    VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice.

What is (are) Shingles ?,"Shingles is a painful rash that develops on one side of the face or body. The rash forms blisters that typically scab over in 7 to 10 days and clear up within 2 to 4 weeks. Most commonly, the rash occurs in a single stripe around either the left or the right side of the body. In other cases, the rash occurs on one side of the face. In rare cases (usually among people with weakened immune systems), the rash may be more widespread and look similar to a chickenpox rash. Shingles is very common. Fifty percent of all Americans will have had shingles by the time they are 80. While shingles occurs in people of all ages, it is most common in 60- to 80-year-olds. In fact, one out of every three people 60 years or older will get shingles. (Watch the video to learn more about shingles. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) What Causes Shingles? Shingles is caused by a reactivation of the chickenpox virus. It is distinctive because it affects only one side of the body. The early signs of shingles usually develop in three stages: severe pain or tingling, possibly itchy rash, and blisters that look like chickenpox. The virus that causes shingles is a herpes virus, (Another name for shingles is herpes zoster.) Once you are infected with this kind of virus, it remains in your body for life. It stays inactive until a period when your immunity is down. Shingles and Pain The most common complication of shingles is pain -- a condition called post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). People with PHN have severe pain in the areas where they had the shingles rash, even after the rash clears up. In most patients, the pain usually clears up in a few weeks or months, but some people can have pain from PHN for years. Persistent pain from shingles is a common symptom in people over 60. In fact, one out of six people older than 60 years who get shingles will have severe pain. As people get older, they are more likely to develop long-term pain as a complication of shingles and the pain is likely to be more severe. Other Complications Shingles may also lead to other serious complications. - Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected.  -  Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring.  Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected. Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring. - In a very small number of cases, bacteria can cause more serious conditions, including toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis, a severe infection that destroys the soft tissue under the skin.  - The burning waves of pain, loss of sleep, and interference with even basic life activities can cause serious depression.  - In patients with immune deficiency, the rash can be much more extensive than usual and the illness can be complicated by pneumonia. These cases are more serious, but they are rarely fatal.  - Very rarely, shingles can also lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or death.

Shingles Usually Does Not Return People who develop shingles usually have only one episode in their lifetime. However, a person can have a second or even a third episode. The Shingles Vaccine Adults 60 years old or older should talk to their healthcare professional about getting a one-time dose of the shingles vaccine. The vaccine can reduce your risk of shingles and the long-term pain it can cause. If you have already had shingles or you have a chronic medical condition, you can receive the shingles vaccine. (See more about the shingles vaccine in the chapter Prevention.) Is Shingles Contagious? Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered. If You Have Shingles If you have shingles, - keep the rash covered  - avoid touching or scratching the rash  - wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus.  keep the rash covered avoid touching or scratching the rash wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus. Until your rash has developed crusts, avoid contact with - pregnant women who have never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine  - premature or low birth weight infants  - people with weakened immune systems, such as people receiving immunosuppressive medications or undergoing chemotherapy, organ transplant recipients, and people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. pregnant women who have never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine premature or low birth weight infants people with weakened immune systems, such as people receiving immunosuppressive medications or undergoing chemotherapy, organ transplant recipients, and people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

What is (are) Shingles ?,"Shingles (herpes zoster) is an outbreak of rash or blisters on the skin that is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox  the varicella-zoster virus. The first sign of shingles is often burning or tingling pain (which can be severe), or sometimes numbness or itch,generally on one side of the body. After several days or a week, a rash of fluid-filled blisters, similar to chickenpox, appears in one area on one side of the body. Shingles pain can be mild or intense. Some people have mostly itching; some feel pain from the gentlest touch or breeze. The most common location for shingles is a band, called a dermatome, spanning one side of the trunk around the waistline. Anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk for shingles. Scientists think that some of the virus particles from the original exposure to the varicella-zoster virus,leave the skin blisters and move into the nervous system. When the varicella-zoster virus reactivates, the virus moves back down the long nerve fibers that extend from the sensory cell bodies to the skin. The viruses multiply, the tell-tale rash erupts, and the person now has shingles.) ",1300,10
Do you have information about Child safety seats (Also called: Child car seats; Infant car seats; Car seats; Car safety seats),"Child safety seats are proven to save children's lives in accidents.  In the United States, all states require children to be secured in a car seat or booster seat until they are 4' 9"" tall. Most children grow to this height when they are between 8 and 12 years old.  To keep your child safe, keep these tips in mind when using a car safety seat.  - When your child is born, you must have a car seat to bring the baby home from the hospital.  - Always secure your child in a car seat whenever riding in a vehicle. Make sure the harness is fastened snugly.  - Read the car seat manufacturer's instructions for the proper way to use the seat. Read your vehicle owner's manual, too.  - Car seats and booster seats should always be used on the back seat of a vehicle. If there is no back seat, the car seat can be secured on the front passenger seat. This can ONLY be done when there is no front or side air bag, or the air bag has been switched off.    When you are selecting a child safety seat for the first time:  - The seat must fit your child's size and be able to be properly installed in your vehicle.  - It is best to use a new car seat. Used car seats often do not have instructions. They may have cracks or other problems that make the seat unsafe. For example, the seat may have been damaged during a car accident.  - Try the seat before buying it. Install the seat in your vehicle. Put your child in the car seat. Secure the harness and buckle. Check that the seat fits your vehicle and child.  - DO NOT use a car seat past its expiration date. The seat frame may no longer be strong enough to support your child safely. The expiration date is usually on the bottom of the seat.  - DO NOT use a seat that has been recalled. Fill out and send in the registration card that comes with the new car seat. The manufacturer can contact you if the seat is recalled. You can find out about recalls by contacting the manufacturer, or by looking up safety complaints records on your child's safety seat at www.safercar.gov/parents/CarSeats/Car-Seat-Safety.htm.    The types of child safety seats and restraints include:  - Rear-facing seats  - Forward-facing seats  - Booster seats  - Car beds  - Built-in car seats  - Travel vests    REAR-FACING SEATS   A rear-facing seat is one in which your child faces the back of the vehicle. The seat should be installed on the back seat of your vehicle. The two types of rear-facing seats are the infant-only seat and the convertible seat.  Infant-only rear-facing seats. These seats are for babies who weigh up to 22 to 30 pounds, depending on the car seat. You will need a new seat when your child gets bigger. Infant-only seats have handles so you can carry the seat to and from the car. Some have a base you can leave installed in the car. This lets you click the car seat into place each time you use it. Follow manufacturer's instructions on how the seat should be reclined so your baby's head does not shift around while you are driving.  Convertible seats. These seats are to be placed in the rear-facing position and are for infants and toddlers. When your child is older and bigger, the seat can be switched to the forward-facing position. Experts recommend keeping your child rear-facing until at least age 2 and until your child outgrows the weight or height allowed by the seat.  FORWARD-FACING SEATS   A forward-facing seat should be installed on the back seat of your vehicle, although it allows your child to face the front of the car. These seats are used only after your child is too big for a rear-facing seat.  A combination forward-facing booster seat may also be used. For younger children, the booster seat's harness straps should be used. After your child reaches the upper height and weight limit for the harness (based on the seat's instructions), the vehicle's own lap and shoulder belts can be used to keep your child strapped in.   BOOSTER SEATS  A booster seat raises your child up so the vehicle's own lap and shoulder belts fit correctly. The lap belt should fall across your child's upper thighs. The shoulder belt should go across the middle of your child's shoulder and chest.  Use booster seats for older children until they are 4' 9"" tall and between 8 and 12 years old.  CAR BEDS  These seats are also called flat car seats. They are used for premature or other special-needs babies. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends having a health care provider look at how your preterm baby fits and breathes in a car seat before leaving the hospital.  BUILT-IN SEATS  Some vehicles have built-in car seats. Weight and height limits vary. You can get more details on these seats by reading the vehicle owner's manual or calling the vehicle manufacturer.  TRAVEL VESTS  Special vests can be worn by older children who have outgrown forward-facing safety seats. The vests can be used instead of booster seats. The vests are used with the vehicle's lap and seat belts. As with car seats, children should be sitting in the back seat when using the vest.) ",1301,10

",1302,6
What causes Contact dermatitis ? (Also called: Dermatitis - contact; Allergic dermatitis; Dermatitis - allergic; Irritant contact dermatitis; Skin rash - contact dermatitis),"There are 2 types of contact dermatitis.  Irritant dermatitis: This is the most common type. It can be by contact with acids, alkaline materials such as soaps and detergents, fabric softeners, solvents, or other chemicals. The reaction most often looks like a burn. It is not caused by an allergy, but rather the skin's reaction to a very irritating substance.  Other materials that may irritate your skin include:  - Cement  - Hair dyes  - Long-term exposure to wet diapers  - Pesticides or weed killers  - Rubber gloves  - Shampoos    Allergic contact dermatitis: This form of the condition occurs when your skin comes in contact with a substance that causes you to have an allergic reaction.   Common allergens include:  - Adhesives, including those used for false eyelashes or toupees  - Antibiotics, such as neomycin rubbed on the surface of the skin  - Balsam of Peru (used in many personal products and cosmetics, as well as in many foods and drinks)  - Fabrics and clothing  - Fragrances in perfumes, cosmetics, soaps, and moisturizers  - Nail polish, hair dyes, and permanent wave solutions  - Nickel or other metals (found in jewelry, watch straps, metal zips, bra hooks, buttons, pocketknives, lipstick holders, and powder compacts)  - Poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, and other plants  - Rubber or latex gloves or shoes    You will not have a reaction to a substance when you are first exposed to the substance. However, you will form a reaction after future exposures. You may become more sensitive and develop a reaction if you use it regularly. The reaction most often occurs 24 to 48 hours after the exposure.   Some products cause a reaction only when the skin is also exposed to sunlight (photosensitivity). These include:  - Shaving lotions  - Sunscreens  - Sulfa ointments  - Some perfumes  - Coal tar products  - Oil from the skin of a lime    A few airborne allergens, such as ragweed or insecticide spray, can also cause contact dermatitis.) ",1303,6
What are the symptoms of Contact dermatitis ? (Also called: Dermatitis - contact; Allergic dermatitis; Dermatitis - allergic; Irritant contact dermatitis; Skin rash - contact dermatitis),"Symptoms vary depending on the cause and whether the dermatitis is due to an allergic reaction or an irritant. The same person may also have different symptoms over time.  Allergic reactions may occur suddenly, or develop after months of exposure.   Contact dermatitis often occurs on the hands. Hair products, cosmetics, and perfumes can lead to skin reactions on the face, head, and neck. Jewelry can also cause skin problems in the area under it.  Itching is a common symptom. In the case of an allergic dermatitis, itching can be severe.   You may have red, streaky, or patchy rash where the substance touched the skin. The allergic reaction is often delayed so that the rash may not appear until 24 to 48 hours after exposure.   The rash may:  - Have red bumps that may form moist, weeping blisters  - Feel warm and tender  - Ooze, drain, or crust  - Become scaly, raw, or thickened    Dermatitis caused by an irritant may also cause burning or pain as well as itching. Irritant dermatitis often shows as dry, red, and rough skin. Cuts (fissures) may form on the hands. Skin may become inflamed with long-term exposure.) ",1304,6
How to diagnose Contact dermatitis ? (Also called: Dermatitis - contact; Allergic dermatitis; Dermatitis - allergic; Irritant contact dermatitis; Skin rash - contact dermatitis),"Your health care provider will make the diagnosis based on how the skin looks and by asking questions about substances you may have come in contact with.  Allergy testing with skin patches (called patch testing) may determine what is causing the reaction. Patch testing is used for certain people who have long-term or repeated contact dermatitis. It requires 3 office visits and must be done by a provider with the skill to interpret the results correctly.   - On the first visit, small patches of possible allergens are applied to the skin. These patches are removed 48 hours later to see if a reaction has occurred.  - A third visit, about 2 days later, is done to look for any delayed reaction.  - If you have already tested a material on a small area of your skin and noticed a reaction, you should bring the material with you.    Other tests may be used to rule out other possible causes, including skin lesion biopsy or culture of the skin lesion.) ",1305,10
What are the treatments for Contact dermatitis ? (Also called: Dermatitis - contact; Allergic dermatitis; Dermatitis - allergic; Irritant contact dermatitis; Skin rash - contact dermatitis),"Your doctor will recommend treatment based on what is causing the problem. In some cases, the best treatment is to do nothing to the area.  Often, treatment includes washing the area with a lot of water to get rid of any traces of the irritant that are still on the skin. You should avoid further exposure to the substance.  Emollients or moisturizers help keep the skin moist, and also help skin repair itself. They protect the skin from becoming inflamed again. They are a key part of preventing and treating contact dermatitis.  Topical corticosteroids are medicines used to treat eczema.  - Topical means you place it on the skin. You will be prescribed a cream or ointment. Topical corticosteroids may also be called topical steroids or topical cortisones.  - DO NOT use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor advises you to use it.    Your provider may also prescribe other creams or ointments, such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus, to use on the skin.  In severe cases, you may need to take corticosteroid pills. Your provider will start you on a high dose and your dose will be slowly reduced over about 12 days. You may also receive a corticosteroid shot.  Wet dressings and soothing anti-itch (antipruritic) lotions may be recommended to reduce other symptoms.) ",1306,9

What is (are) isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome ? (Also called: duplication/inversion 15q11; idic(15); inv dup(15); inverted duplication 15; isodicentric chromosome 15; non-distal tetrasomy 15q),"Isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome is a developmental disorder with a broad spectrum of features. The signs and symptoms vary among affected individuals.  Poor muscle tone is commonly seen in individuals with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome and contributes to delayed development and impairment of motor skills, including sitting and walking.  Babies with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome often have trouble feeding due to weak facial muscles that impair sucking and swallowing; many also have backflow of acidic stomach contents into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux). These feeding problems may make it difficult for them to gain weight.  Intellectual disability in isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome can range from mild to profound. Speech is usually delayed and often remains absent or impaired. Behavioral difficulties often associated with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome include hyperactivity, anxiety, and frustration leading to tantrums. Other behaviors resemble features of autistic spectrum disorders, such as repeating the words of others (echolalia), difficulty with changes in routine, and problems with social interaction.  About two-thirds of people with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome have seizures. In more than half of affected individuals, the seizures begin in the first year of life.  About 40 percent of individuals with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome are born with eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). Hearing loss in childhood is common and is usually caused by fluid buildup in the middle ear. This hearing loss is often temporary. However, if left untreated during early childhood, the hearing loss can interfere with language development and worsen the speech problems associated with this disorder.  Other problems associated with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome in some affected individuals include minor genital abnormalities in males such as undescended testes (cryptorchidism) and a spine that curves to the side (scoliosis).)

What is (are) Asymptomatic HIV infection ?,"Asymptomatic HIV infection is a phase of HIV/AIDS during which there are no symptoms of HIV infection.   During this phase, the immune system in someone with HIV slowly deteriorates, but the person has no symptoms. How long this phase lasts depends on how quickly the HIV virus copies itself, and how the person's genes affect the way the body handles the virus.  Some people can go 10 years or longer without symptoms. Others may have symptoms and worsening immune function within a few years after the original infection.) ",1322,10
What is (are) Screening and diagnosis for HIV ? (Also called: HIV testing; HIV screening; HIV screening test; HIV confirmatory test),"In general, testing for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a 2-step process that involves a screening test and follow-up tests.  SCREENING TESTS  These are tests that check if you've been infected with HIV. The most common tests are described below.  An antibody test (also called immunoassay) checks for antibodiesto the HIV virus. Your health care provider may order the test for you to have done at a lab. Or, you may have it done at a testing center or use a home kit. These tests can detect antibodies starting a few weeks after youre infected with the virus. Antibody tests can be done using:  - Blood -- This test is done by drawing blood from a vein, or by a finger prick. A blood test is the most accurate because blood has a higher level of antibodies than other body fluids.  - Oral fluid -- This test checks for antibodies in the cells of the mouth. It is done by swabbing the gums and inside cheeks. This test is less accurate than the blood test.  - Urine -- This test checks for antibodies in the urine. This test is also less accurate than the blood test.   An antigen test checks your blood for an HIV antigen, called p24. When you're first infected with HIV, and before your body has a chance to make antibodies to the virus, your blood has a high level of p24. The p24 antigen test is accurate 11 days to 1 month after getting infected. This test is usually not used by itself to screen for HIV infection.  An antibody-antigen blood test checks for levels of both HIV antibodies and the p24 antigen. This test can detect the virus as early as 3 weeks after getting infected.  FOLLOW-UP TESTS  A follow-up test is also called a confirmatory test. It is usually done when the screening test is positive. Several kinds of tests may be used to:  - Detect the virus itself  - Detect antibodies more accurately than screening tests  - Tell the difference between the 2 types of virus, HIV-1 and HIV-2) ",1323,5
Who is at risk for Screening and diagnosis for HIV?  (Also called: HIV testing; HIV screening; HIV screening test; HIV confirmatory test),"With the blood test, veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:  - Excessive bleeding  - Fainting or feeling lightheaded  - Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)  - Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)   There are no risks with the oral swab and urine tests.)

What is (are) Alcohol use and safe drinking ? (Also called: Beer consumption; Wine consumption; Hard liquor consumption; Safe drinking),"Alcohol is one of the most widely used drug substances in the world.  TEEN DRINKING  Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month. This is in spite of the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the U.S.  About 1 in 5 teens are considered ""problem drinkers."" This means that they:  - Get drunk  - Have accidents related to alcohol use  - Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol    THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL  Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them:  - Beer is about 5% alcohol, although some beers can have more.  - Wine is usually 12 to 15% alcohol.  - Hard liquor is about 45% alcohol.    Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.  The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.  Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster.Stronger drinks tend to be absorbed faster.  Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your ""blood alcohol level."" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.  Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The legal limit for blood alcohol usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms:  - 0.05 -- reduced inhibitions  - 0.10 -- slurred speech  - 0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment  - 0.30 -- confusion  - 0.40 -- stupor  - 0.50 -- coma  - 0.60 -- respiratory paralysis and death    You can have symptoms of ""being drunk"" at blood alcohol levels below the legal definition of being drunk. Also, people who drink alcohol frequently may not have symptoms until a higher blood alcohol level is reached.  HEALTH RISKS OF ALCOHOL  Alcohol increases the risk of:  - Alcoholism  - Falls, drownings, and other accidents  - Head, neck, stomach, and breast cancers  - Motor vehicle accidents  - Risky sex behaviors, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  - Suicide and homicide    Drinking during pregnancy can harm the developing baby. Severe birth defects or fetal alcohol syndrome are possible.  RESPONSIBLE DRINKING  If you drink alcohol, it is best to do so in moderation. Moderation means the drinking is not getting you intoxicated (or drunk) and you are drinking no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman and no more than 2 if you are a man. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 ounces of liquor.  Here are some ways to drink responsibly, provided you do not have a drinking problem, are of legal age to drink alcohol, and are not pregnant:  - Never drink alcohol and drive a car.  - If you are going to drink, have a designated driver, or plan an alternative way home, such as a taxi or bus.  - Do not drink on an empty stomach. Snack before and while drinking alcohol.    If you are taking medication, including over-the-counter drugs, check with your doctor before drinking alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of many medicines stronger. It can also interact with other medicines, making them ineffective or dangerous or make you sick.  If alcohol use runs in your family, you may be at increased risk of developing this disease yourself. So, you may want to avoid drinking alcohol altogether.  CALL YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IF:  - You are concerned about your personal alcohol use or that of a family member  - You are interested in more information regarding alcohol use or support groups  - You are unable to reduce or stop your alcohol consumption, in spite of attempts to stop drinking    Other resources include:  - Local Alcoholics Anonymous or Al-anon/Alateen groups  - Local hospitals  - Public or private mental health agencies  - School or work counselors  - Student or employee health centers) ",1326,2

What is (are) congenital diaphragmatic hernia ? (Also called: congenital diaphragmatic defect),"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a defect in the diaphragm. The diaphragm, which is composed of muscle and other fibrous tissue, separates the organs in the abdomen from those in the chest. Abnormal development of the diaphragm before birth leads to defects ranging from a thinned area in the diaphragm to its complete absence. An absent or partially formed diaphragm results in an abnormal opening (hernia) that allows the stomach and intestines to move into the chest cavity and crowd the heart and lungs. This crowding can lead to underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia), potentially resulting in life-threatening breathing difficulties that are apparent from birth.  In 5 to 10 percent of affected individuals, signs and symptoms of congenital diaphragmatic hernia appear later in life and may include breathing problems or abdominal pain from protrusion of the intestine into the chest cavity. In about 1 percent of cases, congenital diaphragmatic hernia has no symptoms; it may be detected incidentally when medical imaging is done for other reasons.  Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are often classified by their position. A Bochdalek hernia is a defect in the side or back of the diaphragm. Between 80 and 90 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernias are of this type. A Morgnani hernia is a defect involving the front part of the diaphragm. This type of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which accounts for approximately 2 percent of cases, is less likely to cause severe symptoms at birth. Other types of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, such as those affecting the central region of the diaphragm, or those in which the diaphragm muscle is absent with only a thin membrane in its place, are rare.) ",1352,10
What are the genetic changes related to congenital diaphragmatic hernia ? (Also called: congenital diaphragmatic defect),"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia has many different causes. In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the condition appears as a feature of a disorder that affects many body systems, called a syndrome. Donnai-Barrow syndrome, Fryns syndrome, and Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome are among several syndromes in which congenital diaphragmatic hernia may occur. Some of these syndromes are caused by changes in single genes, and others are caused by chromosomal abnormalities that affect several genes.  About 25 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia that is not associated with a known syndrome also have abnormalities of one or more major body systems. Affected body systems can include the heart, brain, skeleton, intestines, genitals, kidneys, or eyes. In these individuals, the multiple abnormalities likely result from a common underlying disruption in development that affects more than one area of the body, but the specific mechanism responsible for this disruption is not clear.  Approximately 50 to 60 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernia cases are isolated, which means that affected individuals have no other major malformations.  More than 80 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have no known genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. Researchers are studying changes in several genes involved in the development of the diaphragm as possible causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Some of these genes are transcription factors, which provide instructions for making proteins that help control the activity of particular genes (gene expression). Others provide instructions for making proteins involved in cell structure or the movement (migration) of cells in the embryo. Environmental factors that influence development before birth may also increase the risk of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, but these environmental factors have not been identified.) ",1353,10

Donnai-Barrow syndrome, Fryns syndrome, and Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome are among several syndromes in which congenital diaphragmatic hernia may occur. Some of these syndromes are caused by changes in single genes, and others are caused by chromosomal abnormalities that affect several genes.  About 25 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia that is not associated with a known syndrome also have abnormalities of one or more major body systems. Affected body systems can include the heart, brain, skeleton, intestines, genitals, kidneys, or eyes. In these individuals, the multiple abnormalities likely result from a common underlying disruption in development that affects more than one area of the body, but the specific mechanism responsible for this disruption is not clear.  Approximately 50 to 60 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernia cases are isolated, which means that affected individuals have no other major malformations.  More than 80 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have no known genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. Researchers are studying changes in several genes involved in the development of the diaphragm as possible causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Some of these genes are transcription factors, which provide instructions for making proteins that help control the activity of particular genes (gene expression). Others provide instructions for making proteins involved in cell structure or the movement (migration) of cells in the embryo. Environmental factors that influence development before birth may also increase the risk of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, but these environmental factors have not been identified.) ",1356,10
Is congenital diaphragmatic hernia inherited ? (Also called: congenital diaphragmatic defect),"Isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia is rarely inherited. In almost all cases, there is only one affected individual in a family.  When congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs as a feature of a genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality, it may cluster in families according to the inheritance pattern for that condition.)

What is (are) Adolescent test or procedure preparation ? (Also called: Test/procedure preparation - adolescent; Preparing adolescent for test/procedure; Preparing for a medical test or procedure - adolescent),"There are many ways to help an adolescent prepare for a medical test or procedure.  First, provide detailed information and explain the reasons for the procedure. Let your adolescent take part and make as many decisions as possible.  PREPARING BEFORE THE PROCEDURE  Explain the procedure in correct medical terms. Tell your adolescent why the test is being done. (Ask your health care provider to explain it if you are not sure.) Understanding the need for the procedure may reduce your adolescent's anxiety.  To the best of your ability, describe how the test will feel. Allow your adolescent to practice the positions or movements that will be required for the test, such as the fetal position for a lumbar puncture.  Be honest about discomfort your adolescent may feel, but don't dwell on it. It may help to stress the benefits of the test, and to say that the test results may provide more information. Talk about things that your adolescent may enjoy after the test, such as feeling better or going home. Rewards such as shopping trips or movies may be helpful if the adolescent is able to do them.  Tell your adolescent as much as you can about the equipment that will be used for the test. If the procedure will take place in a new location, it may help to tour the facility with your adolescent before the test.  Suggest ways for your adolescent to stay calm, such as:  - Blowing bubbles  - Breathing deeply  - Counting  - Creating a quiet, peaceful environment  - Doing relaxation techniques (thinking pleasant thoughts)  - Holding the hand of a calm parent (or someone else) during the procedure  - Playing hand-held video games  - Using guided imagery  - Trying other distractions, such as listening to music through headphones, if allowed    When possible, let your adolescent make some decisions, such as deciding the time of day or the date of the procedure. The more control a person has over a procedure, the less painful and anxiety-producing it is likely to be.  Allow your adolescent to participate in simple tasks during the procedure, such as holding an instrument, if allowed.  Discuss possible risks. Adolescents are often concerned about risks, particularly about any effects on their appearance, mental function, and sexuality. Address these fears honestly and openly if at all possible. Provide information about any appearance changes or other possible side effects the test may cause.  Older adolescents may benefit from videos that show adolescents of the same age explaining and through the procedure. Ask your health care provider if such films are available for your adolescent to view. It may also be helpful for your adolescent to discuss any concerns with peers who have managed similar stressful situations. Ask your health care provider if they know any teens who are interested in doing peer counseling, or if they can recommend a local support group.  DURING THE PROCEDURE  If the procedure is done at a hospital or your health care provider's office, ask if you can stay with your adolescent. However, if your adolescent does not want you to be there, honor this wish. Out of respect for your adolescent's growing need for privacy and independence, do not allow peers or siblings to watch the procedure unless adolescent asks them to be there.  Do not show your own anxiety. Looking anxious will make your adolescent more upset and worried. Research suggests that children are more cooperative if their parents take measures (such as acupuncture) to reduce their own anxiety.  Other considerations:  - Ask your health care provider to limit the number of strangers entering and leaving the room during the procedure. This can raise anxiety.  - Ask that the provider who has spent the most time with your adolescent be present during the procedure, if possible.  - Your adolescent may have a hard time with a new authority figure entering the situation. This complication can be reduced if someone he or she knows performs the test. Otherwise, your adolescent may show some resistance. Prepare your adolescent in advance for the possibility that the test will be done by someone he or she doesn't know.  - Ask that anesthesia be used, if appropriate, to reduce any discomfort.  - Assure your adolescent that his or her reactions are normal.)

What is (are) Infant test/procedure preparation ? (Also called: Test/procedure preparation - infant; Preparing infant for test/procedure),"Be aware that your child will likely cry, and restraints may be used. The most important way you can help your infant through this procedure is by being there and showing you care.  Crying is a normal response to the strange environment, unfamiliar people, restraints, and separation from you. Your infant will cry more for these reasons than because the test or procedure is uncomfortable.  WHY RESTRAINTS?  Infants lack the physical control, coordination, and ability to follow commands that older children usually have. Restraints may be used during a procedure or other situation to ensure your infant's safety. For example, in order to get clear test results on an x-ray, there cannot be any movement. Your infant may be restrained by hand or with physical devices.  If blood needs to be taken or an IV started, restraints are important in preventing injury to your infant. If your infant moves while the needle is being inserted, the needle could damage a blood vessel, bone, tissue, or nerves.  Your provider will use every means to ensure the safety and comfort of your baby. Beside restraints, other measures include medications, observation, and monitors.  DURING THE PROCEDURE  Your presence helps your infant during the procedure, especially if the procedure allows you to maintain physical contact. If the procedure is performed at the hospital or your health care provider's office, you will likely be able to be present.  If you are not asked to be by your infant's side and would like to be, ask your provider if this is possible. If you think you may become ill or anxious, consider keeping your distance, but staying in your infant's line of vision. If you are not able to be present, leaving a familiar object with your infant may be comforting.  OTHER CONSIDERATIONS  - Ask your provider to limit the number of strangers entering and leaving the room during the procedure, since this can raise anxiety.  - Ask that the provider who has spent the most time with your child perform the procedure.  - Ask that anesthetics be used if appropriate to reduce your child's discomfort.  - Ask that painful procedures not be done in the hospital crib, so that the infant does not come to associate pain with the crib. Many hospitals have special treatment rooms where procedures are done.  - Imitate the behavior you or your health care provider need the infant to do, such as opening the mouth.  - Many children's hospitals have child life specialists who are specially trained to educate patients and families and advocate for them during procedures. Ask if such a person is available.) ",1363,6

What is (are) Preschooler test or procedure preparation ? (Also called: Preparing preschoolers for test/procedure; Test/procedure preparation - preschooler),"Preparing children for medical tests can reduce their distress. It can also make them less likely to cry and resist the procedure. Research shows that lowering anxiety can decrease the sensation of pain people feel during uncomfortable procedures. Even so, being prepared may not change the fact that your child will feel some discomfort or pain.  Before the test, understand that your child will probably cry. Demonstrate in advance what will happen during the test to learn about your child's fears and concerns. Using a doll or other object to act out the test may reveal worries your child may not be able to talk about, and may reduce your child's anxiety.  Most people are frightened of the unknown. It helps if your child knows what to expect. If your child's fears are not realistic, explaining what will actually happen can help. If your child is worried about a part of the test, do not minimize this concern. Reassure your child that you will be there to help as much as you can.  Make sure your child understands that the procedure is not a punishment. Preschool-age children may believe that the pain they feel is a punishment for something they did.  The most important way you can help your child is to prepare properly, and provide support and comfort around the time of the procedure. Ask if the hospital has a child life specialist who can help you before and after the procedure.  PREPARING BEFORE THE PROCEDURE:  Keep your explanations about the procedure to 10 or 15 minutes. Preschoolers have a limited attention span. Explain the test or procedure right before it takes place so that your child doesn't worry about it for days or weeks in advance.  Here are some general guidelines for preparing your child for a test or procedure:  - Explain the procedure in language your child understands, using plain words and avoiding abstract terms.  - Use play preparation to demonstrate the procedure to your child and identify concerns (see the next section).  - Make sure your child understands the body part involved in the test, and that the procedure will be limited to that area.  - Describe as best as you can how the test will feel.  - Be honest with your child about any discomfort or pain the test may cause.  - If the procedure affects a part of the body that your child needs for a certain function (such as speaking, hearing, or urinating), explain what changes will occur afterwards.  - Give your child permission to yell, cry, or express pain in another way using sounds or words.  - Ask if your child has questions about something you have explained.  - Allow your child to practice the positions or movements that will be required for the particular procedure, such as the fetal position for a lumbar puncture.  - Stress the benefits of the procedure and talk about things the child may enjoy after the test, such as feeling better or going home. You may want to take your child for ice cream or some other treat afterwards, but do not make the treat a condition of ""being good"" for the test.  - Practice deep breathing and other comforting activities with your child. If possible, have your child hold your hand and squeeze it when feeling pain.  - Ask the health care provider if your child can make some decisions, when appropriate, such as which arm should have the IV or what color bandage to use.  - Distract your child during and after the procedure with books, songs, counting, deep breathing, or blowing bubbles.    PLAY PREPARATION  Play can be a wonderful way to demonstrate the procedure for your child and identify any anxiety your child may have. Tailor this technique to your child. Most health care facilities for children use play to prepare children for procedures.  Many young children have a favorite toy or other important object that can be a tool for a process called third-party communication. It may be less threatening for your child to express concerns through the toy or object instead of directly. For example, a child who is about to have blood drawn may be better able to understand if you discuss how the ""doll might feel"" during the test.  Toys or dolls can help you explain the procedure to your preschooler. Once you are familiar with the procedure, briefly demonstrate on the toy what your child will experience. Using the toy, show your child:  - Bandages  - How injections are given  - How IVs are inserted  - How surgical cuts are made  - Stethoscopes  - What positions your child will be in    After your demonstration, allow your child to play with some of the items (except for needles and other sharp items). Watch your child for clues about concerns or fears.  No matter what test is performed, your child will probably cry. This is a normal response to a strange environment, unfamiliar people, and separation from you. Knowing this from the beginning may help relieve some of your anxiety about what to expect.  WHY RESTRAINTS?  Your child may be restrained by hand or with physical devices. Young children lack the physical control, coordination, and ability to follow commands that older children and adults usually have. Most tests and procedures require limited or no movement to ensure their accuracy. For example, to get clear results with x-rays there must not be any movement.   Restraints may also be used during a procedure or other situation to ensure your child's safety. Restraints may be used to keep your child safe when staff temporarily have to leave the room during x-ray and nuclear studies. They may also be used when a puncture is done to get a blood sample or start an IV. If your child moves, the needle could cause an injury.  Your child's health care provider will use every method to make sure your child is safe and comfortable. Besides restraints, other measures include medications, monitors, and observation.  Your job as a parent is to comfort your child.  DURING THE PROCEDURE:  Your presence may help your child during the procedure, especially if the procedure allows you to maintain physical contact. If the procedure is performed at the hospital or at your child's health care provider's office, you may be able to be there. If you are not sure, ask if you can be there.  If you think you may become ill or anxious, consider keeping your distance, but stay were your child can see you. If youcannot be present, leave a familiar object with your child for comfort.  Avoid showing your anxiety. This will only make your child feel more upset. Research suggests that children are more cooperative if their parents take measures (such as acupuncture) to reduce their own anxiety. If you are feeling stressed and anxious, consider asking friends and family members for help. They can provide child care for other siblings or meals for the family so you can focus on supporting your child.   Other considerations:  - Ask your child's health care provider to limit the number of strangers entering and leaving the room during the procedure, because this can raise anxiety.  - Ask if the provider who has spent the most time with your child can be present during the procedure.  - Ask if anesthesia can be used, if appropriate, to reduce your child's discomfort.  - Ask that painful procedures not be performed in the hospital bed, so that the child does not link pain with the hospital room.  - If your child can see you during the procedure, do what your child is told to do, such as opening your mouth.  - Ask if a low sensory environment can be created.)

What is (are) Shingles vaccine - what you need to know ?,"What is shingles?  Shingles is a painful skin rash, often with blisters. It is also called Herpes Zoster, or just Zoster.  A shingles rash usually appears on one side of the face or body and lasts from 2 to 4 weeks. Its main symptom is pain, which can be quite severe. Other symptoms of shingles can include fever, headache, chills and upset stomach. Very rarely, a shingles infection can lead to pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness, brain inflammation (encephalitits) or death.  For about 1 person in 5, severe pain can continue even long after the rash clears up. This is called post-herpetic neuralgia.  Shingles is caused by the Varicella Zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox.  Only someone who has had chickenpox -- or, rarely, has gotten chickenpox vaccine -- can get shingles. The virus stays in your body, and can cause shingles many years later.  You can't catch shingles from another person with shingles. However, a person who has never had chickenpox (or chickenpox vaccine) could get chickenpox from someone with shingles. This is not very common.  Shingles is far more common in people 50 years of age and older than in younger people. It is also more common in people whose immune systems are weakened because of a disease such as cancer, or drugs such as steroids or chemotherapy.  At least 1 million people a year in the United States get shingles. Shingles vaccine  A vaccine for shingles was licensed in 2006. In clinical trials, the vaccine reduced the risk of shingles by 50%. It can also reduce pain in people who still get shingles after being vaccinated.  A single dose of shingles vaccine is recommended for adults 60 years of age and older. Some people should not get shingles vaccine or should wait.  A person should not get shingles vaccine who:  - Has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of shingles vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies.  - Has a weakened immune system because of current:        - AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system,    - Treatment with drugs that affect the immune system, such as prolonged use of high-dose steroids,    - Cancer treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy,    - Cancer affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system, such as leukemia or lymphoma.      - Is pregnant, or might be pregnant. Women should not become pregnant until at least 4 weeks after getting shingles vaccine.    Someone with a minor acute illness, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. But anyone with a moderate or severe acute illness should usually wait until they recover before getting the vaccine. This includes anyone with a temperature of 101.3F or higher. What are the risks from shingles vaccine?  A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. However, the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small.  No serious problems have been identified with shingles vaccine.  Mild problems  - Redness, soreness, swelling, or itching at the site of the injection (about 1 person in 3).  - Headache (about 1 person in 70).    Like all vaccines, shingles vaccine is being closely monitored for unusual or severe problems. What if there is a serious reaction?  What should I look for?  - Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes.    Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.   What should I do?  - If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.  - Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the VAERS website or by calling 1-800-822-7967.    VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice. How can I learn more?  - Ask your doctor.  - Contact your local or state health department.  - Contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):        - Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO)    - Visit CDC's vaccines website) ",1368,8

Like all vaccines, shingles vaccine is being closely monitored for unusual or severe problems. What if there is a serious reaction?  What should I look for?  - Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes.    Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.   What should I do?  - If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.  - Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the VAERS website or by calling 1-800-822-7967.    VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice. How can I learn more?  - Ask your doctor.  - Contact your local or state health department.  - Contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):        - Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO)    - Visit CDC's vaccines website) ",1377,8
How to prevent Shingles ?,"Yes. In May 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a vaccine to prevent shingles in people age 60 and older. The vaccine, called Zostavax, is designed to boost the immune system and protect older adults from getting shingles later on. Even if you have had shingles, you can still get the shingles vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. There is no maximum age for getting the vaccine, and only a single dose is recommended. The shingles vaccine is NOT recommended if you have active shingles or pain that continues after the rash is gone. (Watch the video to learn more about shingles treatments.

What causes Shingles ?,"Caused By A Virus Shingles is caused by a virus called varicella-zoster virus -- the one that gave you chickenpox when you were a child. As you recovered from chickenpox, the sores healed and the other symptoms went away, but the virus remained. It is with you for life. The virus hides out in nerve cells, usually in the spine. But it can become active again. Somehow, the virus gets a signal that your immunity has become weakened. This triggers the reactivation. When the virus becomes active again, it follows a nerve path called a dermatome. The nerve path begins at specific points in the spine, continues around one side of the body, and surfaces at the nerve endings in the skin. The pattern of the rash reflects the location of that nerve path. Risk Factors The leading risk factor for shingles is a history of having had chickenpox. One out of every five people who have had chickenpox is likely to get shingles. Another risk factor is aging. As we age, our natural immunity gradually loses its ability to protect against infection. The shingles virus can take advantage of this and become active again. Conditions that weaken the immune system can also put people at risk for shingles. Shingles is especially dangerous for anyone who has had cancer, radiation treatments for cancer, HIV/AIDS, or a transplant operation. Stress is another factor that may contribute to outbreaks. While stress alone does not cause the outbreaks, shingles often occurs in people who have recently had a stressful event in their lives. Most cases of shingles occur in adults. Only about 5 percent of cases occur in children. With children, immune deficiency is the primary risk factor, but children who had chickenpox before they were one year old may also get shingles before they become adults. There have been studies of adults who had chickenpox as children and were later exposed to children who had chickenpox. Interestingly, that exposure apparently boosted the adult's immunity, which actually helped them avoid getting shingles later in life.) ",1379,10

As you recovered from chickenpox, the sores and other symptoms healed, but the virus remained. It is with you for life. Researchers know that the varicella-zoster virus behaves differently from other viruses, such as the flu virus. Our immune system usually kills off invading germs, but it cannot completely knock out this type of virus. The virus just becomes inactive. The virus can become active again, especially in the later years of your life when your immune system doesn't protect you as well from infections. The virus travels from the spinal nerve cells and follows a nerve path out to the skin. Nerve endings in the skin become inflamed and erupt in a very painful rash. Healthcare providers cannot always be sure what the trigger is in each case. They don't know why the virus reactivates in one person with these risk factors, while in another person with the same risk factors, it does not.) ",1381,10

After several days or a week, a rash of fluid-filled blisters, similar to chickenpox, appears in one area on one side of the body. Shingles pain can be mild or intense. Some people have mostly itching; some feel pain from the gentlest touch or breeze. The most common location for shingles is a band, called a dermatome, spanning one side of the trunk around the waistline. Anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk for shingles. Scientists think that some of the virus particles from the original exposure to the varicella-zoster virus,leave the skin blisters and move into the nervous system. When the varicella-zoster virus reactivates, the virus moves back down the long nerve fibers that extend from the sensory cell bodies to the skin.

It stays inactive until a period when your immunity is down. Shingles and Pain The most common complication of shingles is pain -- a condition called post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). People with PHN have severe pain in the areas where they had the shingles rash, even after the rash clears up. In most patients, the pain usually clears up in a few weeks or months, but some people can have pain from PHN for years. Persistent pain from shingles is a common symptom in people over 60. In fact, one out of six people older than 60 years who get shingles will have severe pain. As people get older, they are more likely to develop long-term pain as a complication of shingles and the pain is likely to be more severe. Other Complications Shingles may also lead to other serious complications. - Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected.  -  Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring.

Shingles Usually Does Not Return People who develop shingles usually have only one episode in their lifetime. However, a person can have a second or even a third episode. The Shingles Vaccine Adults 60 years old or older should talk to their healthcare professional about getting a one-time dose of the shingles vaccine. The vaccine can reduce your risk of shingles and the long-term pain it can cause. If you have already had shingles or you have a chronic medical condition, you can receive the shingles vaccine. (See more about the shingles vaccine in the chapter Prevention.) Is Shingles Contagious? Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered. If You Have Shingles If you have shingles, - keep the rash covered  - avoid touching or scratching the rash  - wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus.  keep the rash covered avoid touching or scratching the rash wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus.

What is (are) Developmental disorders of the female reproductive tract ?,"Developmental disorders of the female reproductive tract are problems in a baby girl's reproductive organs that occur while she is growing in her mother's body.  Female reproductive organs include the vagina, ovaries, uterus, and cervix.) ",1391,0
What causes Developmental disorders of the female reproductive tract ?,"A baby starts to develop its reproductive organs between weeks 4 and 5 of pregnancy. This development continues until the 20th week of pregnancy.  The development is a complex process. Many different things can interrupt the process. How severe your baby's problem is depends on when the interruption occurred. In general, the earlier development problems occur in the womb, the more serious the problem.  Problems in the development of a girl's reproductive organs may be caused by:  - Broken or missing genes (genetic defect)  - Use of certain drugs during pregnancy   For example, some babies may have a genetic defect that prevents their body from producing a substance called 21-hydroxylase. If a developing baby girl lacks this substance, she will be born with a uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes, but her external genitals will look like those found on boys. See: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia  Certain drugs that the mother takes can pass into the baby's bloodstream and interfere with organ development. One drug known to do this is diethylstilbestrol (DES). Doctors once prescribed this medicine to pregnant women to prevent miscarriage and early labor. However, scientists learned that baby girls born to women who took this drug had an abnormally shaped uterus. The drug also increased the daughters' chances of developing a rare form of vaginal cancer.  Sometimes, a developmental disorder can be seen as soon as the baby is born. It may cause life-threatening conditions in the newborn. Other times, the condition is not diagnosed until the girl is older.  The reproductive tract develops close to the urinary tract and kidneys. It also develops at the same time as several other organs. As a result, developmental problems in the female reproductive tract sometimes occur with problems in other areas, including the urinary tract, kidneys, and lower spine.  Developmental disorders of the female reproductive tract include intersex and ambiguous genitalia. See the specific articles for information on these conditions.  Other developmental disorders of the female reproductive tract include:  - Cloacal abnormalities -- The cloaca is a tube-like structure. In the early stages of a baby's development, the urinary tract, rectum, and vagina all empty into this one tube. But, later in development, the three areas separate and have their own openings. If the cloaca persists as a baby girl grows in the womb, all the openings do not form. For example, a baby may be born with only one opening on the bottom of the body near the rectal area. Urine and feces cannot drain out of the body. This can cause severe pain, stomach swelling, and breathing problems. Some cloacal abnormalities may cause a baby girl to look like she has a male's penis. These birth defects are rare.  - Problems with outer (external) genitals -- Developmental problems may lead to a swollen clitoris or fused labia (when the folds of tissue around the opening of the vagina are joined together). Most other problems of the outer genitals are related to intersex or ambiguous genitalia.  - Imperforate hymen -- The hymen is a thin tissue that partly covers the opening to the vagina. An imperforate hymen completely blocks the vaginal opening. This often leads to painful swelling of the vagina. Sometimes, the hymen has only a very small opening or tiny small holes. This problem may not be discovered until puberty. Some baby girls are born without a hymen.  - Ovarian problems -- A baby girl may have an extra ovary, extra tissue attached to an ovary, or structures called ovotestes that have both male and female tissue.  - Uterus and cervix problems-- A baby girl may be born with an extra cervix and uterus, a half-formed uterus, or a blockage of the uterus. Usually, girls born with half a uterus and half a vagina are missing the kidney on the same side of the body.  - Vaginal problems-- A baby girl may be born without a vagina or have the vaginal opening blocked by a layer of cells that are higher up in the vagina than where the hymen is. A missing vagina is most often due to Mayer-Rokitansky-Kster-Hauser syndrome. In this syndrome, the baby is missing part or all of the internal reproductive organs (uterus, cervix, and fallopian tubes). Other abnormalities include having two vaginas or a vagina that opens into the urinary tract, a heart shaped uterus, and a uterus with a wall in the middle of the cavity) ",1392,0

It is characterized by mildly unusual facial characteristics, short stature, heart defects, bleeding problems, skeletal malformations, and many other signs and symptoms.  People with Noonan syndrome have distinctive facial features such as a deep groove in the area between the nose and mouth (philtrum), widely spaced eyes that are usually pale blue or blue-green in color, and low-set ears that are rotated backward. Affected individuals may have a high arch in the roof of the mouth (high-arched palate), poor alignment of the teeth, and a small lower jaw (micrognathia). Many children with Noonan syndrome have a short neck and both children and adults may have excess neck skin (also called webbing) and a low hairline at the back of the neck.  Approximately 50 to 70 percent of individuals with Noonan syndrome have short stature. At birth, they are usually of normal length and weight, but growth slows over time. Abnormal levels of growth hormone may contribute to the slow growth.  Individuals with Noonan syndrome often have either a sunken chest (pectus excavatum) or a protruding chest (pectus carinatum). Some affected people may also have an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis).  Most people with Noonan syndrome have a heart defect. The most common heart defect is a narrowing of the valve that controls blood flow from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary valve stenosis). Some affected individuals have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a thickening of the heart muscle that forces the heart to work harder to pump blood.  A variety of bleeding disorders have been associated with Noonan syndrome. Some people may have excessive bruising, nosebleeds, or prolonged bleeding following injury or surgery. Women with a bleeding disorder typically have excessive bleeding during menstruation (menorrhagia) or childbirth.  Adolescent males with Noonan syndrome typically experience delayed puberty. Affected individuals go through puberty starting at age 13 or 14 and have a reduced pubertal growth spurt. Most males with Noonan syndrome have undescended testicles (cryptorchidism), which may be related to delayed puberty or to infertility (inability to father a child) later in life.

What is (are) antiphospholipid syndrome ? (Also called: anti-phospholipid syndrome; antiphospholipid antibody syndrome; Hughes syndrome),"Antiphospholipid syndrome is a disorder characterized by an increased tendency to form abnormal blood clots (thromboses) that can block blood vessels. This clotting tendency is known as thrombophilia. In antiphospholipid syndrome, the thromboses can develop in nearly any blood vessel in the body, but most frequently occur in the vessels of the lower limbs. If a blood clot forms in the vessels in the brain, blood flow is impaired and can lead to stroke. Antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs.  Women with antiphospholipid syndrome are at increased risk of complications during pregnancy. These complications include pregnancy-induced high blood pressure (preeclampsia), an underdeveloped placenta (placental insufficiency), early delivery, or pregnancy loss (miscarriage). In addition, women with antiphospholipid syndrome are at greater risk of having a thrombosis during pregnancy than at other times during their lives. At birth, infants of mothers with antiphospholipid syndrome may be small and underweight.  A thrombosis or pregnancy complication is typically the first sign of antiphospholipid syndrome. This condition usually appears in early to mid-adulthood but can begin at any age.  Other signs and symptoms of antiphospholipid syndrome that affect blood cells and vessels include a reduced amount of blood clotting cells called platelets (thrombocytopenia), a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) due to their premature breakdown (hemolysis), and a purplish skin discoloration (livedo reticularis) caused by abnormalities in the tiny blood vessels of the skin. In addition, affected individuals may have open sores (ulcers) on the skin, migraine headaches, heart disease, or intellectual disability. Many people with antiphospholipid syndrome also have other autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus.  Rarely, people with antiphospholipid syndrome develop thromboses in multiple blood vessels throughout their body. These thromboses block blood flow in affected organs, which impairs their function and ultimately causes organ failure. These individuals are said to have catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS). CAPS typically affects the kidneys, lungs, brain, heart, and liver, and is fatal in over half of affected individuals. Less than 1 percent of individuals with antiphospholipid syndrome develop CAPS.)

What are the genetic changes related to antiphospholipid syndrome ? (Also called: anti-phospholipid syndrome; antiphospholipid antibody syndrome; Hughes syndrome),"The genetic cause of antiphospholipid syndrome is unknown. This condition is associated with the presence of three abnormal immune proteins (antibodies) in the blood: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-B2 glycoprotein I. Antibodies normally bind to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction, but the antibodies in antiphospholipid syndrome attack normal human proteins. When these antibodies attach (bind) to proteins, the proteins change shape and bind to other molecules and receptors on the surface of cells. Binding to cells, particularly immune cells, turns on (activates) the blood clotting pathway and other immune responses.  The production of lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-B2 glycoprotein I may coincide with exposure to foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, that are similar to normal human proteins. Exposure to these foreign invaders may cause the body to produce antibodies to fight the infection, but because the invaders are so similar to the body's own proteins, the antibodies also attack the human proteins. Similar triggers may occur during pregnancy when a woman's physiology, particularly her immune system, adapts to accommodate the developing fetus. These changes during pregnancy may explain the high rate of affected females.  Certain genetic variations (polymorphisms) in a few genes have been found in people with antiphospholipid syndrome and may predispose individuals to produce the specific antibodies known to contribute to the formation of thromboses. However, the contribution of these genetic changes to the development of the condition is unclear.  People who test positive for all three antibodies but have not had a thrombosis or recurrent miscarriages are said to be antiphospholipid carriers. These individuals are at greater risk of developing a thrombosis than is the general population.) ",1417,7

What is (are) Antiphospholipid Syndrome ?,"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder caused when antibodies -- immune system cells that fight off bacteria and viruses -- mistakenly attack healthy body tissues and organs. In APS, specific antibodies activate the inner lining of blood vessels, which leads to the formation of blood clots in arteries or veins. APS is sometimes called sticky blood syndrome, because of the increased tendency to form blood clots in the veins and arteries. The symptoms of APS are due to the abnormal blood clotting. Clots can develop in the veins of the legs and lungs, or in the placenta of pregnant women. One of the most serious complications of APS occurs when a clot forms in the brain and causes a stroke. Other neurological symptoms include chronic headaches, dementia (similar to the dementia of Alzheimers disease), and seizures. Infrequently, individuals will develop chorea (a movement disorder in which the body and limbs writhe uncontrollably), cognitive dysfunction (such as poor memory), transverse myelitis, depression or psychosis, optic neuropathy, or sudden hearing loss. In pregnant women, clots in the placenta can cause miscarriages. APS is diagnosed by the presence of a positive antiphospholipid antibody and either a history of blood clots in an artery or vein or a history of multiple miscarriages or other pregnancy problems.

The following factors can increase the amount of normal vaginal discharge:  - Feeling stressed  - Ovulation (the production and release of an egg from your ovary in the middle of your menstrual cycle)  - Pregnancy  - Sexual excitement    Different types of infections may cause itching or a discharge in the vagina. These include:  - Infections spread during sexual contact. These include chlamydia, gonorrhea (GC), and trichomoniasis.  - Vaginal yeast infection, caused by a fungus.  - Normal bacteria that live in the vagina that overgrow, causing a gray discharge and fishy odor. This is called bacterial vaginosis (BV). BV is not often spread through sexual contact.    Other causes of vaginal discharge and itching may be:  - Menopause and low estrogen levels, which may lead to vaginal dryness and other symptoms (Atrophic vaginitis).  - Forgotten tampon or foreign body, which may cause a foul odor.  - Chemicals found in detergents, fabric softeners, feminine sprays, ointments, creams, douches, and contraceptive foams or jellies orcreams, which may irritate the vagina or the skin around the vagina   Less common causes include:  - Cancer of the cervix or vagina   - Skin conditions, such as desquamative vaginitis and lichen planus) ",1442,0

Dry thoroughly afterward.   Avoid douching. Many women feel cleaner when they douche, but it may actually worsen symptoms because it removes healthy bacteria that line the vagina. These bacteria help protect against infection.   Other tips are:   - Avoid using hygiene sprays, fragrances, or powders in the genital area.   - Use pads and not tampons while you have an infection.   - If you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar levels in good control.   Allow more air to reach your genital area. You can do this by:   - Wearing loose-fitting clothes and not wearing panty hose   - Wearing cotton underwear (rather than synthetic), or underwear that has a cotton lining in the crotch. Cotton increases air flow and decreases moisture buildup.   - Not wearing underwear at night when you sleep.   Girls and women should also:   - Know how to properly clean their genital area while bathing or showering.   - Wipe properly after using the toilet -- always from front to back.   - Wash thoroughly before and after using the bathroom.

What causes Infertility ? (Also called: Inability to conceive; Unable to get pregnant),"Many physical and emotional factors can cause infertility. It may be due to problems in the woman, man, or both.  FEMALE INFERTILITY  Female infertility may occur when:  - A fertilized egg or embryo does not survive once it attaches to the lining of the womb (uterus).  - The fertilized egg does not attach to the lining of the uterus.  - The eggs cannot move from the ovaries to the womb.  - The ovaries have problems producing eggs.    Female infertility may be caused by:   - Autoimmune disorders, such as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)  - Birth defects that affect the reproductive tract  - Cancer or tumor  - Clotting disorders  - Diabetes  - Drinking too much alcohol  - Exercising too much  - Eating disorders or poor nutrition  - Growths (such as fibroids or polyps) in the uterus and cervix  - Medicines such as chemotherapy drugs  - Hormone imbalances  - Obesity  - Older age  - Ovarian cysts and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)  - Pelvic infection or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)  - Scarring from sexually transmitted infection, abdominal surgery or endometriosis  - Smoking  - Surgery to prevent pregnancy (tubal ligation) or failure of tubal ligation reversal (reanastomosis)  - Thyroid disease    MALE INFERTILITY  Male infertility may be due to:  - Decreased number of sperm  - Blockage that prevents the sperm from being released  - Defects in the sperm    Male infertility can be caused by:  - Birth defects  - Cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation  - Exposure to high heat for prolonged periods  - Heavy use of alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine  - Hormone imbalance  - Impotence  - Infection  - Medicines such as cimetidine, spironolactone, and nitrofurantoin  - Obesity  - Older age  - Retrograde ejaculation  - Scarring from sexually transmitted infections, injury, or surgery  - Smoking  - Toxins in the environment  - Vasectomy or failure of vasectomy reversal    Healthy couples under age 30 who have sex regularly will have a 25 to 30% per month chance of getting pregnant each month.  A woman is most fertile in her early 20s. The chance a woman can get pregnant drops greatly after age 35 (and especially after age 40). The age when fertility starts to decline varies from woman to woman.  Infertility problems and miscarriage rates increase significantly after 35 year of age. There are now options for early egg retrieval and storage for women in their 20's. This will help ensure a successful pregnancy if childbearing is delayed until after age 35. This is an expensive option, but for women who know they will need to delay childbearing, it may be worth considering.) ",1461,0
How to diagnose Infertility ? (Also called: Inability to conceive; Unable to get pregnant),"Deciding when to get treated for infertility depends on your age. Health care providers often suggest that women under 30 try to get pregnant on their own for 1 year before getting tested.  Many experts recommend that women over 35 attempt conception for only 6 months. If a pregnancy does not occur within that time, they should talk to their provider.   Infertility testing involves a medical history and physical exam for both partners.  Blood and imaging tests are most often needed. In women, these may include:  - Blood tests to check hormone levels, including progesterone and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)  - Home urine ovulation detection kits  - Measurement of body temperature every morning to see if the ovaries are releasing eggs  - FSH and clomid challenge test  - Antimullerian hormone testing (AMH)  - Hysterosalpingography (HSG)  - Pelvic ultrasound  - Laparoscopy  - Thyroid function tests    Tests in men may include:  - Sperm testing  - Exam of the testes and penis  - Ultrasound of the male genitals (sometimes done)  - Blood tests to check hormone levels  - Testicular biopsy (rarely done)) ",1462,6
What are the treatments for Infertility ? (Also called: Inability to conceive; Unable to get pregnant),"Treatment depends on the cause of infertility. It may involve:  - Education and counseling about the condition  - Fertility treatments such as intrauterine insemination (IUI) and in vitro fertilization (IVF)  - Medicines to treat infections and clotting disorders  - Medicines that help the growth and release of eggs from the ovaries   Couples can increase the chances of becoming pregnant each month by having sex at least every 3 days before and during ovulation.   Ovulation occurs about 2 weeks before the next menstrual cycle (period) starts. Therefore, if a woman gets her period every 28 days the couple should have sex at least every 3 days between the 10th and 18th day after her period starts.  Having sex before ovulation occurs is especially helpful.   - Sperm can live inside a woman's body for at least 3 days.   - However, a woman's egg can only be fertilized by the sperm for a few hours after it is released.    Women who are under or overweight, may increase their chances of becoming pregnant by getting to a healthier weight.) ",1463,0

A person who self-harms usually does not mean to kill himself or herself. But they are at higher risk of attempting suicide if they do not get help.    Self-harm tends to begin in teen or early adult years. Some people may engage in self-harm a few times and then stop. Others engage in it more often and have trouble stopping.    Examples of self-harm include       - Cutting yourself (such as using a razor blade, knife, or other sharp object to cut the skin)    - Punching yourself or punching things (like a wall)    - Burning yourself with cigarettes, matches, or candles    - Pulling out your hair    - Poking objects through body openings    - Breaking your bones or bruising yourself       Many people cut themselves because it gives them a sense of relief. Some people use cutting as a means to cope with a problem. Some teens say that when they hurt themselves, they are trying to stop feeling lonely, angry, or hopeless.    It is possible to overcome the urge to hurt yourself. There are other ways to find relief and cope with your emotions. Counseling may help.

Who should get Simvastatin and why is it prescribed ?,"Simvastatin is used together with diet, weight-loss, and exercise to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and to decrease the chance that heart surgery will be needed in people who have heart disease or who are at risk of developing heart disease. Simvastatin is also used to decrease the amount of fatty substances such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (''bad cholesterol'') and triglycerides in the blood and to increase the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (''good cholesterol'') in the blood. Simvastatin may also be used to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood in children and teenagers 10 to 17 years of age who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Simvastatin is in a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). It works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body.  Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats with simvastatin has been shown to prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks.) ",1500,0

What causes Drug allergies ? (Also called: Allergic reaction - drug (medication); Drug hypersensitivity; Medication hypersensitivity),"Adverse reactions to drugs are common. (adverse means unwanted or unexpected.) Almost any drug can cause an adverse reaction. Reactions range from irritating or mild side effects such as nausea and vomiting to life-threatening anaphylaxis.  A true drug allergy is caused by a series of chemical steps in the body that produce the allergic reaction to a medication.  The first time you take the medicine, you may have no problems. However, your body's immune system may produce a substance (antibody) called IgE against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the IgE tells your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine, which causes your allergy symptoms. A drug allergy may also occur without your body producing IgE. Instead, it might produce other types of antibodies, or have other reactions that do not produce antibodies.  Most drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. Serum sickness is a delayed type of drug allergy that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medication or vaccine.  Common allergy-causing drugs include:  -  Anticonvulsants   -  Insulin (especially animal sources of insulin)   -  Iodinated (containing iodine) x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like reactions)   -  Penicillin and related antibiotics   -  Sulfa drugs    Most side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction. For example, aspirin can cause nonallergic hives or trigger asthma. Some drug reactions are considered idiosyncratic. This means the reaction is an unusual effect of the medication. It is not due to a known chemical effect of the drug. Many people confuse an uncomfortable, but not serious, side effect of a medicine (such as nausea) with a true drug allergy.) ",1521,2

Treatment most often involves medicines, counseling, and support. You and your health care provider will discuss your care and treatment goals.  Withdrawal can take place in a number of settings:  - At-home, using medicines and a strong support system. (This method is difficult, and withdrawal should be done very slowly.)  - Using facilities set up to help people with detoxification (detox).  - In a regular hospital, if symptoms are severe.   MEDICINES  Methadone relieves withdrawal symptoms and helps with detox. It is also used as a long-term maintenance medicine for opioid dependence. After a period of maintenance, the dose may be decreased slowly over a long time. This helps reduce the intensity of withdrawal symptoms. Some people stay on methadone for years.  Buprenorphine (Subutex) treats withdrawal from opiates, and it can shorten the length of detox. It may also be used for long-term maintenance, like methadone. Buprenorphine may be combined with Naloxone (Bunavail, Suboxone, Zubsolv), which helps prevent dependence and misuse.  Clonidine is used to help reduce anxiety, agitation, muscle aches, sweating, runny nose, and cramping. It does not help reduce cravings.  Other medicines can:  - Treat vomiting and diarrhea  - Help with sleep   Naltrexone can help prevent relapse. It is available in pill form or as an injection.  People who go through withdrawal over and over should be treated with long-term methadone or buprenorphine maintenance.  Most people need long-term treatment after detox. This can include:  - Self-help groups, like Narcotics Anonymous or SMART Recovery  - Outpatient counseling  - Intensive outpatient treatment (day hospitalization)  - Inpatient treatment   Anyone going though detox for opiates should be checked for depression and other mental illnesses. Treating these disorders can reduce the risk of relapse. Antidepressant medicines should be given as needed.) ",1532,1

Do you have information about Over-the-counter pain relievers (Also called: Medications for painnon-narcotic; Drugs for pain non-narcotic; Analgesics; Acetaminophen; NSAID; Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; Pain medicine - over-the-counter; Pain medicine - OTC),"Pain medicines are also called analgesics. Each kind of pain medicine has benefits and risks. Some types of pain respond better to one kind of medicine than to another kind. What takes away your pain might not work for someone else.  Taking pain medicines before exercising is OK. But do not overdo the exercise just because you have taken the medicine.  Read labels to learn how much medicine you can give your child at one time and during thewhole day. This is known as the dosage. Talk to your pharmacist or your childs health care provider if you are not sure about the correct amount. Do not give children medicine that is meant for adults.  Other tips for taking pain medicines:  - If you take pain relievers on most days, tell your health care provider. You may need to be watched for side effects.  - Do not take more than the amount recommended on thecontainer or more than your provider tells you to take.  - Read the warnings on the label before taking the medicine.  - Store medicine safely and securely. Check the dates on medicinecontainers to see when you should throwthem away.    Acetaminophen  Acetaminophen is known as a non-aspirin pain reliever. It is NOT an NSAID, which is described below.  - Acetaminophen relieves fever and headaches, and other common aches and pains. It does not relieve inflammation.  - This medicine does not cause as many stomach problems as other pain medicines do. It is also safer for children. Acetaminophen is often recommended for arthritis pain because it has fewer side effects than other pain medicines.  - Examples of OTC brands of acetaminophen are Tylenol, Paracetamol, and Panadol.  - Acetaminophen prescribed by a doctor is usually a stronger medicine. It is often combined with a narcotic ingredient.    Precautions  - Adults should not take more than 3 grams (3,000 mg) of acetaminophen in a single day. Large amounts can harm your liver. Remember that 3 grams is about the same as six extra-strength pills or nine regular pills.  - If you are also taking pain medicine prescribed by your health care provider, talk to your provider or pharmacist before taking any OTC acetaminophen.  - For children, follow package instructions for the maximum amount your child can have in a single day. Call your health care provider if you are not sure about the instructions.    NSAIDs  - NSAIDs relieve fever and pain. They also reduce swelling from arthritis or a muscle sprain or strain.  - When taken for a short time (no longer than 10 days), NSAIDs are safe for most people.  - Some NSAIDs can be bought over the counter, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn).  - Other NSAIDs are prescribed by your health care provider.    Precautions  - DO NOT give aspirin to children. Reye syndrome can occur when aspirin is used to treat children who have viral infections, such as chickenpox or the flu.    Talk to your health care provider or pharmacist before using any over-the-counter NSAID if you:  - Have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or stomach or digestive tract bleeding.  - Take other medicines, especially blood thinners such as warfarin or clopidgrel.  - Are taking NSAIDs prescribed by your health care provider, including celecoxib (Celebrex) or nabumetone (Relafen).)

What is (are) Pain medications - narcotics ? (Also called: Painkillers; Drugs for pain; Analgesics; Opioids),"Narcotics are also called opioid pain relievers. They are used only for pain that is severe and is not helped by other types of painkillers. When used carefully and under a health care provider's direct care, these drugs can be effective at reducing pain.  Narcotics work by binding to receptors in the brain, which blocks the feeling of pain.  You should not use a narcotic drug for more than 3 to 4 months, unless you are under direct care of your provider.  NAMES OF NARCOTICS  - Codeine  - Fentanyl -- available as a patch  - Hydrocodone  - Hydromorphone  - Meperidine  - Morphine  - Oxycodone  - Tramadol   TAKING NARCOTICS  These drugs can be abused and habit-forming. They have been associated with accidental overdose deaths. Always take narcotics as prescribed. Your provider may suggest that you take your medicine only when you feel pain.  Or, your doctor may suggest taking a narcotic on a regular schedule. Allowing the medicine to wear off before taking more of it can make the pain difficult to control.   Taking narcotics to control the pain of cancer or other medical problems does not itself lead to dependence.  Store narcotics safely and securely in your home.  You may need a pain specialist to help you manage long-term pain.  SIDE EFFECTS OF NARCOTICS  Drowsiness and impaired judgment often occur with these medicines. When taking a narcotic, do not drink alcohol, drive, or operate heavy machinery.  You can relieve itching by reducing the dose or talking to your doctor about switching medicines.  To help with constipation, drink more fluids, get more exercise, eat foods with extra fiber, and use stool softeners.  If nausea or vomiting occur, try taking the narcotic with food.  Withdrawal symptoms are common when you stop taking a narcotic. Symptoms include strong desire for the medicine (craving), yawning, insomnia, restlessness, mood swings, or diarrhea. To prevent withdrawal symptoms, your doctor may recommend you gradually lower the dosage over time.) ",1538,4

What to do for Electrical injury ? (Also called: Electrical shock),"1. If you can do so safely, turn off the electrical current. Unplug the cord, remove the fuse from the fuse box, or turn off the circuit breakers. Simply turning off an appliance may NOT stop the flow of electricity. Do NOT attempt to rescue a person near active high-voltage lines.  2. Call your local emergency number, such as 911.   3. If the current can't be turned off, use a non-conducting object, such as a broom, chair, rug, or rubber doormat to push the person away from the source of the current. Do not use a wet or metal object. If possible, stand on something dry that doesn't conduct electricity, such as a rubber mat or folded newspapers.  4. Once the person is away from the source of electricity, check the person's airway, breathing, and pulse. If either has stopped or seems dangerously slow or shallow, start first aid.   5. If the person has a burn, remove any clothing that comes off easily and rinse the burned area in cool, running water until the pain subsides. Give first aid for burns.  6. If the person is faint, pale, or shows other signs of shock, lay him or her down, with the head slightly lower than the trunk of the body and the legs elevated, and cover him or her with a warm blanket or a coat.  7. Stay with the person until medical help arrives.  8. Electrical injury is frequently associated with explosions or falls that can cause additional severe injuries. You may not be able to notice all of them. Do not move the person's head or neck if the spine may be injured.  9. If you are a passenger in a vehicle struck by a power line, remain in it until help arrives unless a fire has started.

What causes Swallowing difficulty ? (Also called: Dysphagia; Impaired swallowing; Choking - food; Globus sensation),"The process of swallowing involves several steps. These include   - Chewing food  - Moving it into the back of the mouth  - Moving it down the esophagus (the tube that moves food to the stomach)    There are many nerves that help the muscles of the mouth, throat, and esophagus work together. Much of swallowing occurs without you being aware of what you are doing.  A brain or nerve disorder can alter the workings of the muscles of the mouth and throat.  Swallowing is a complex act. Many nerves work in a fine balance to control how the muscles of the mouth, throat, and esophagus work together.  A brain or nerve disorder can alter this fine balance in the muscles of the mouth and throat.  - Damage to the brain may be caused by multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, or stroke.  - Nerve damage may be due to spinal cord injuries, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease), or myasthenia gravis.    Stress or anxiety may cause some people to feel tightness in the throat, or feel as if something is stuck in the throat. This sensation is unrelated to eating and is called globus hystericus.  Problems that involve the esophagus often cause swallowing problems. These may include:  - An abnormal ring of tissue that forms where the esophagus and stomach meet (called Schatzki's ring)  - Abnormal spasms of the esophagus muscles  - Cancer of the esophagus  - Failure of the muscle ring at the bottom of the esophagus to relax (Achalasia)  - Scarring that narrows the esophagus. This may be due to radiation, chemicals, medicines, chronic swelling, ulcers, or infection.  - Something stuck in the esophagus, such as a piece of food.  - Scleroderma, a disorder in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the esophagus  - Tumors in the chest that press on the esophagus) ",1569,1

What is (are) leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter ? (Also called: CACH syndrome; childhood ataxia with central nervous system hypomyelination; Cree leukoencephalopathy; myelinosis centralis diffusa; vanishing white matter disease; vanishing white matter leukodystrophy),"Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is a progressive disorder that mainly affects the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). This disorder causes deterioration of the central nervous system's white matter, which consists of nerve fibers covered by myelin. Myelin is the fatty substance that insulates and protects nerves.  In most cases, people with leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter show no signs or symptoms of the disorder at birth. Affected children may have slightly delayed development of motor skills such as crawling or walking. During early childhood, most affected individuals begin to develop motor symptoms, including abnormal muscle stiffness (spasticity) and difficulty with coordinating movements (ataxia). There may also be some deterioration of mental functioning, but this is not usually as pronounced as the motor symptoms. Some affected females may have abnormal development of the ovaries (ovarian dysgenesis). Specific changes in the brain as seen using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are characteristic of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter, and may be visible before the onset of symptoms.  While childhood onset is the most common form of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter, some severe forms are apparent at birth. A severe, early-onset form seen among the Cree and Chippewayan populations of Quebec and Manitoba is called Cree leukoencephalopathy. Milder forms may not become evident until adolescence or adulthood, when behavioral or psychiatric problems may be the first signs of the disease. Some females with milder forms of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter who survive to adolescence exhibit ovarian dysfunction. This variant of the disorder is called ovarioleukodystrophy.  Progression of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is generally uneven, with periods of relative stability interrupted by episodes of rapid decline. People with this disorder are particularly vulnerable to stresses such as infection, mild head trauma or other injury, or even extreme fright. These stresses may trigger the first symptoms of the condition or worsen existing symptoms, and can cause affected individuals to become lethargic or comatose.) ",1592,7

What are the genetic changes related to leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter ? (Also called: CACH syndrome; childhood ataxia with central nervous system hypomyelination; Cree leukoencephalopathy; myelinosis centralis diffusa; vanishing white matter disease; vanishing white matter leukodystrophy),"Mutations in the EIF2B1, EIF2B2, EIF2B3, EIF2B4, and EIF2B5 genes cause leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter.  The EIF2B1, EIF2B2, EIF2B3, EIF2B4 and EIF2B5 genes provide instructions for making the five parts (subunits) of a protein called eIF2B. The eIF2B protein helps regulate overall protein production (synthesis) in the cell by interacting with another protein, eIF2. The eIF2 protein is called an initiation factor because it is involved in starting (initiating) protein synthesis. Proper regulation of protein synthesis is vital for ensuring that the correct levels of protein are available for the cell to cope with changing conditions. For example, cells must synthesize protein much faster if they are multiplying than if they are in a resting state.  Mutations have been identified in all five of the genes from which the eIF2B protein is produced, although most of these mutations (about 65 percent) occur in the EIF2B5 gene. These mutations cause partial loss of eIF2B function in various ways. For example, they may impair the ability of one of the protein subunits to form a complex with the others, or make it more difficult for the protein to attach to the initiation factor.  Partial loss of eIF2B function makes it more difficult for the body's cells to regulate protein synthesis and deal with changing conditions and stress. Researchers believe that cells in the white matter may be particularly affected by an abnormal response to stress, resulting in the signs and symptoms of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter.)

What is (are) sick sinus syndrome ? (Also called: sinus node disease; sinus node dysfunction; SND; SSS),"Sick sinus syndrome (also known as sinus node dysfunction) is a group of related heart conditions that can affect how the heart beats. ""Sick sinus"" refers to the sino-atrial (SA) node, which is an area of specialized cells in the heart that functions as a natural pacemaker. The SA node generates electrical impulses that start each heartbeat. These signals travel from the SA node to the rest of the heart, signaling the heart (cardiac) muscle to contract and pump blood. In people with sick sinus syndrome, the SA node does not function normally. In some cases, it does not produce the right signals to trigger a regular heartbeat. In others, abnormalities disrupt the electrical impulses and prevent them from reaching the rest of the heart.  Sick sinus syndrome tends to cause the heartbeat to be too slow (bradycardia), although occasionally the heartbeat is too fast (tachycardia). In some cases, the heartbeat rapidly switches from being too fast to being too slow, a condition known as tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome. Symptoms related to abnormal heartbeats can include dizziness, light-headedness, fainting (syncope), a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations), and confusion or memory problems. During exercise, many affected individuals experience chest pain, difficulty breathing, or excessive tiredness (fatigue). Once symptoms of sick sinus syndrome appear, they usually worsen with time. However, some people with the condition never experience any related health problems.  Sick sinus syndrome occurs most commonly in older adults, although it can be diagnosed in people of any age. The condition increases the risk of several life-threatening problems involving the heart and blood vessels. These include a heart rhythm abnormality called atrial fibrillation, heart failure, cardiac arrest, and stroke.) ",1597,7
What are the genetic changes related to sick sinus syndrome ? (Also called: sinus node disease; sinus node dysfunction; SND; SSS),"Sick sinus syndrome can result from genetic or environmental factors. In many cases, the cause of the condition is unknown.  Genetic changes are an uncommon cause of sick sinus syndrome. Mutations in two genes, SCN5A and HCN4, have been found to cause the condition in a small number of families. These genes provide instructions for making proteins called ion channels that transport positively charged atoms (ions) into cardiac cells, including cells that make up the SA node. The flow of these ions is essential for creating the electrical impulses that start each heartbeat and coordinate contraction of the cardiac muscle. Mutations in these genes reduce the flow of ions, which alters the SA node's ability to create and spread electrical signals. These changes lead to abnormal heartbeats and the other symptoms of sick sinus syndrome.  A particular variation in another gene, MYH6, appears to increase the risk of developing sick sinus syndrome. The protein produced from the MYH6 gene forms part of a larger protein called myosin, which generates the mechanical force needed for cardiac muscle to contract. Researchers believe that the MYH6 gene variation changes the structure of myosin, which can affect cardiac muscle contraction and increase the likelihood of developing an abnormal heartbeat.  More commonly, sick sinus syndrome is caused by other factors that alter the structure or function of the SA node. These include a variety of heart conditions, other disorders such as muscular dystrophy, abnormal inflammation, or a shortage of oxygen (hypoxia). Certain medications, such as drugs given to treat abnormal heart rhythms or high blood pressure, can also disrupt SA node function. One of the most common causes of sick sinus syndrome in children is trauma to the SA node, such as damage that occurs during heart surgery.  In older adults, sick sinus syndrome is often associated with age-related changes in the heart. Over time, the SA node may harden and develop scar-like damage (fibrosis) that prevents it from working properly.) ",1598,7

What causes Pediatric sleep apnea ? (Also called: Sleep apnea - pediatric; Apnea - pediatric sleep apnea syndrome; Sleep-disordered breathing - pediatric),"During sleep, all of the muscles in the body become more relaxed. This includes the muscles that help keep the throat open so air can flow into the lungs.  Normally, the throat remains open enough during sleep to let air pass by. However, some children have a narrow throat. This is often this is because of large tonsils or adenoids, which partially block the airflow. When the muscles in their upper throat relax during sleep, the tissues close in and block the airway. This stop in breathing is called apnea.  Other factors that also may increase the risk of sleep apnea in children include:  - A small jaw  - Certain shapes of the roof of the mouth (palate)   - Large tongue, which may fall back and block the airway  - Obesity  - Poor muscle tone due to conditions such as Down syndrome or cerebral palsy) ",1606,6
What is (are) Sleep Apnea ? (Also called: Sleep-disordered breathing),"Sleep apnea is a common disorder that causes your breathing to stop or get very shallow. Breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30 times or more an hour.    The most common type is obstructive sleep apnea. It causes your airway to collapse or become blocked during sleep. Normal breathing starts again with a snort or choking sound. People with sleep apnea often snore loudly. However, not everyone who snores has sleep apnea.    You are more at risk for sleep apnea if you are overweight, male, or have a family history or small airways. Children with enlarged tonsils may also get it.    Doctors diagnose sleep apnea based on medical and family histories, a physical exam, and sleep study results.    When your sleep is interrupted throughout the night, you can be drowsy during the day. People with sleep apnea are at higher risk for car crashes, work-related accidents, and other medical problems. If you have it, it is important to get treatment. Lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, surgery, and breathing devices can treat sleep apnea in many people.

What is (are) Alcohol use and safe drinking ? (Also called: Beer consumption; Wine consumption; Hard liquor consumption; Safe drinking),"Alcohol is one of the most widely used drug substances in the world.  TEEN DRINKING  Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month. This is in spite of the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the U.S.  About 1 in 5 teens are considered ""problem drinkers."" This means that they:  - Get drunk  - Have accidents related to alcohol use  - Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol    THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL  Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them:  - Beer is about 5% alcohol, although some beers can have more.  - Wine is usually 12 to 15% alcohol.  - Hard liquor is about 45% alcohol.    Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.  The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.  Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster.Stronger drinks tend to be absorbed faster.  Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your ""blood alcohol level."" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.  Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The legal limit for blood alcohol usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms:  - 0.05 -- reduced inhibitions  - 0.10 -- slurred speech  - 0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment  - 0.30 -- confusion  - 0.40 -- stupor  - 0.50 -- coma  - 0.60 -- respiratory paralysis and death    You can have symptoms of ""being drunk"" at blood alcohol levels below the legal definition of being drunk. Also, people who drink alcohol frequently may not have symptoms until a higher blood alcohol level is reached.  HEALTH RISKS OF ALCOHOL  Alcohol increases the risk of:  - Alcoholism  - Falls, drownings, and other accidents  - Head, neck, stomach, and breast cancers  - Motor vehicle accidents  - Risky sex behaviors, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  - Suicide and homicide    Drinking during pregnancy can harm the developing baby. Severe birth defects or fetal alcohol syndrome are possible.  RESPONSIBLE DRINKING  If you drink alcohol, it is best to do so in moderation. Moderation means the drinking is not getting you intoxicated (or drunk) and you are drinking no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman and no more than 2 if you are a man. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 ounces of liquor.  Here are some ways to drink responsibly, provided you do not have a drinking problem, are of legal age to drink alcohol, and are not pregnant:  - Never drink alcohol and drive a car.  - If you are going to drink, have a designated driver, or plan an alternative way home, such as a taxi or bus.  - Do not drink on an empty stomach. Snack before and while drinking alcohol.    If you are taking medication, including over-the-counter drugs, check with your doctor before drinking alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of many medicines stronger. It can also interact with other medicines, making them ineffective or dangerous or make you sick.  If alcohol use runs in your family, you may be at increased risk of developing this disease yourself. So, you may want to avoid drinking alcohol altogether.  CALL YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IF:  - You are concerned about your personal alcohol use or that of a family member  - You are interested in more information regarding alcohol use or support groups  - You are unable to reduce or stop your alcohol consumption, in spite of attempts to stop drinking    Other resources include:  - Local Alcoholics Anonymous or Al-anon/Alateen groups  - Local hospitals  - Public or private mental health agencies  - School or work counselors  - Student or employee health centers) ",1617,2

What causes Asthma ? (Also called: Bronchial asthma; Wheezing - asthma - adults),"Asthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) in the airways. When an asthma attack occurs, the lining of the air passages swells and the muscles surrounding the airways become tight. This reduces the amount of air that can pass through the airway.  In people who have sensitive airways, asthma symptoms can be triggered by breathing insubstances called allergens or triggers.   Common asthma triggers include:  - Animals (pet hair or dander)  - Dust mites  - Certain medicines (aspirin and other NSAIDS)  - Changes in weather (most often cold weather)  - Chemicals in the air or in food  - Exercise  - Mold  - Pollen  - Respiratory infections, such as the common cold  - Strong emotions (stress)  - Tobacco smoke   Substances in some workplaces can also trigger asthma symptoms, leading to occupational asthma.

Do you have information about Child safety seats (Also called: Child car seats; Infant car seats; Car seats; Car safety seats),"Child safety seats are proven to save children's lives in accidents.  In the United States, all states require children to be secured in a car seat or booster seat until they are 4' 9"" tall. Most children grow to this height when they are between 8 and 12 years old.  To keep your child safe, keep these tips in mind when using a car safety seat.  - When your child is born, you must have a car seat to bring the baby home from the hospital.  - Always secure your child in a car seat whenever riding in a vehicle. Make sure the harness is fastened snugly.  - Read the car seat manufacturer's instructions for the proper way to use the seat. Read your vehicle owner's manual, too.  - Car seats and booster seats should always be used on the back seat of a vehicle. If there is no back seat, the car seat can be secured on the front passenger seat. This can ONLY be done when there is no front or side air bag, or the air bag has been switched off.    When you are selecting a child safety seat for the first time:  - The seat must fit your child's size and be able to be properly installed in your vehicle.  - It is best to use a new car seat. Used car seats often do not have instructions. They may have cracks or other problems that make the seat unsafe. For example, the seat may have been damaged during a car accident.  - Try the seat before buying it. Install the seat in your vehicle. Put your child in the car seat. Secure the harness and buckle. Check that the seat fits your vehicle and child.  - DO NOT use a car seat past its expiration date. The seat frame may no longer be strong enough to support your child safely. The expiration date is usually on the bottom of the seat.  - DO NOT use a seat that has been recalled. Fill out and send in the registration card that comes with the new car seat. The manufacturer can contact you if the seat is recalled. You can find out about recalls by contacting the manufacturer, or by looking up safety complaints records on your child's safety seat at www.safercar.gov/parents/CarSeats/Car-Seat-Safety.htm.    The types of child safety seats and restraints include:  - Rear-facing seats  - Forward-facing seats  - Booster seats  - Car beds  - Built-in car seats  - Travel vests    REAR-FACING SEATS   A rear-facing seat is one in which your child faces the back of the vehicle. The seat should be installed on the back seat of your vehicle. The two types of rear-facing seats are the infant-only seat and the convertible seat.  Infant-only rear-facing seats. These seats are for babies who weigh up to 22 to 30 pounds, depending on the car seat. You will need a new seat when your child gets bigger. Infant-only seats have handles so you can carry the seat to and from the car. Some have a base you can leave installed in the car. This lets you click the car seat into place each time you use it. Follow manufacturer's instructions on how the seat should be reclined so your baby's head does not shift around while you are driving.  Convertible seats. These seats are to be placed in the rear-facing position and are for infants and toddlers. When your child is older and bigger, the seat can be switched to the forward-facing position. Experts recommend keeping your child rear-facing until at least age 2 and until your child outgrows the weight or height allowed by the seat.  FORWARD-FACING SEATS   A forward-facing seat should be installed on the back seat of your vehicle, although it allows your child to face the front of the car. These seats are used only after your child is too big for a rear-facing seat.  A combination forward-facing booster seat may also be used. For younger children, the booster seat's harness straps should be used. After your child reaches the upper height and weight limit for the harness (based on the seat's instructions), the vehicle's own lap and shoulder belts can be used to keep your child strapped in.   BOOSTER SEATS  A booster seat raises your child up so the vehicle's own lap and shoulder belts fit correctly. The lap belt should fall across your child's upper thighs. The shoulder belt should go across the middle of your child's shoulder and chest.  Use booster seats for older children until they are 4' 9"" tall and between 8 and 12 years old.  CAR BEDS  These seats are also called flat car seats. They are used for premature or other special-needs babies. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends having a health care provider look at how your preterm baby fits and breathes in a car seat before leaving the hospital.  BUILT-IN SEATS  Some vehicles have built-in car seats. Weight and height limits vary. You can get more details on these seats by reading the vehicle owner's manual or calling the vehicle manufacturer.  TRAVEL VESTS  Special vests can be worn by older children who have outgrown forward-facing safety seats. The vests can be used instead of booster seats. The vests are used with the vehicle's lap and seat belts. As with car seats, children should be sitting in the back seat when using the vest.) ",1633,10

What is (are) allergic asthma ? (Also called: extrinsic asthma),"Asthma is a breathing disorder characterized by inflammation of the airways and recurrent episodes of breathing difficulty. These episodes, sometimes referred to as asthma attacks, are triggered by irritation of the inflamed airways. In allergic asthma, the attacks occur when substances known as allergens are inhaled, causing an allergic reaction. Allergens are harmless substances that the body's immune system mistakenly reacts to as though they are harmful. Common allergens include pollen, dust, animal dander, and mold. The immune response leads to the symptoms of asthma. Allergic asthma is the most common form of the disorder.  A hallmark of asthma is bronchial hyperresponsiveness, which means the airways are especially sensitive to irritants and respond excessively. Because of this hyperresponsiveness, attacks can be triggered by irritants other than allergens, such as physical activity, respiratory infections, or exposure to tobacco smoke, in people with allergic asthma.  An asthma attack is characterized by tightening of the muscles around the airways (bronchoconstriction), which narrows the airway and makes breathing difficult. Additionally, the immune reaction can lead to swelling of the airways and overproduction of mucus. During an attack, an affected individual can experience chest tightness, wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing. Over time, the muscles around the airways can become enlarged (hypertrophied), further narrowing the airways.  Some people with allergic asthma have another allergic disorder, such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or food allergies. Asthma is sometimes part of a series of allergic disorders, referred to as the atopic march. Development of these conditions typically follows a pattern, beginning with eczema (atopic dermatitis), followed by food allergies, then hay fever, and finally asthma. However, not all individuals with asthma have progressed through the atopic march, and not all individuals with one allergic disease will develop others.) ",1644,6
What is (are) Bad Breath ? (Also called: Halitosis),"There are many reasons why you might have bad breath. You can get it if you don't brush and floss regularly.

Sinusitis or problems with your nose may be to blame. You can also have bad breath if you eat some foods, like raw onions, garlic or cabbage. And of course smoking causes its own bad aroma. Some diseases and medicines are associated with a specific breath odor.      Having good dental habits, like brushing and flossing regularly, help fight bad breath. Mouthwashes, mints or chewing gum may make your breath fresher. If you have an underlying disorder, treating it may help eliminate the breath odor.) ",1645,9
How to prevent Asthma ? (Also called: Bronchial asthma; Wheezing - asthma - adults),"You can reduce asthma symptoms by avoiding triggers and substances that irritate the airways.  - Cover bedding with allergy-proof casings to reduce exposure to dust mites.  - Remove carpets from bedrooms and vacuum regularly.  - Use only unscented detergents and cleaning materials in the home.  - Keep humidity levels low and fix leaks to reduce the growth of organisms such as mold.  - Keep the house clean and keep food in containers and out of bedrooms. This helps reduce the possibility of cockroaches. Body parts and droppingsfrom cockroachescan trigger asthma attacks in some people.  - If someone is allergic to an animal that cannot be removed from the home, the animal should be kept out of the bedroom. Place filtering material over the heating outlets to trap animal dander. Change the filter in furnaces and air conditioners often.  - Eliminate tobacco smoke from the home. This is the single most important thing a family can do to helpsomeone with asthma. Smoking outside the house is not enough. Family members and visitors who smoke outside carry smoke residue inside on their clothes and hair. This can trigger asthma symptoms.

Breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30 times or more an hour.    The most common type is obstructive sleep apnea. It causes your airway to collapse or become blocked during sleep. Normal breathing starts again with a snort or choking sound. People with sleep apnea often snore loudly. However, not everyone who snores has sleep apnea.    You are more at risk for sleep apnea if you are overweight, male, or have a family history or small airways. Children with enlarged tonsils may also get it.    Doctors diagnose sleep apnea based on medical and family histories, a physical exam, and sleep study results.    When your sleep is interrupted throughout the night, you can be drowsy during the day. People with sleep apnea are at higher risk for car crashes, work-related accidents, and other medical problems.

What is (are) progressive familial heart block ? (Also called: bundle branch block; HBBD; hereditary bundle branch defect; hereditary bundle branch system defect; Lenegre Lev disease; Lev-Lengre disease; Lev syndrome; Lev's disease; PCCD; progressive cardiac conduction defect),"Progressive familial heart block is a genetic condition that alters the normal beating of the heart. A normal heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals that move through the heart in a highly coordinated way. These signals begin in a specialized cluster of cells called the sinoatrial node (the heart's natural pacemaker) located in the heart's upper chambers (the atria). From there, a group of cells called the atrioventricular node carries the electrical signals to another cluster of cells called the bundle of His. This bundle separates into multiple thin spindles called bundle branches, which carry electrical signals into the heart's lower chambers (the ventricles). Electrical impulses move from the sinoatrial node down to the bundle branches, stimulating a normal heartbeat in which the ventricles contract slightly later than the atria.  Heart block occurs when the electrical signaling is obstructed anywhere from the atria to the ventricles. In people with progressive familial heart block, the condition worsens over time: early in the disorder, the electrical signals are partially blocked, but the block eventually becomes complete, preventing any signals from passing through the heart. Partial heart block causes a slow or irregular heartbeat (bradycardia or arrhythmia, respectively), and can lead to the buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the cells that carry electrical impulses. Fibrosis contributes to the development of complete heart block, resulting in uncoordinated electrical signaling between the atria and the ventricles and inefficient pumping of blood in the heart. Complete heart block can cause a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations), shortness of breath, fainting (syncope), or sudden cardiac arrest and death.  Progressive familial heart block can be divided into type I and type II, with type I being further divided into types IA and IB. These types differ in where in the heart signaling is interrupted and the genetic cause. In types IA and IB, the heart block originates in the bundle branch, and in type II, the heart block originates in the atrioventricular node. The different types of progressive familial heart block have similar signs and symptoms.  Most cases of heart block are not genetic and are not considered progressive familial heart block. The most common cause of heart block is fibrosis of the heart, which occurs as a normal process of aging. Other causes of heart block can include the use of certain medications or an infection of the heart tissue.) ",1688,7
How many people are affected by progressive familial heart block ? (Also called: bundle branch block; HBBD; hereditary bundle branch defect; hereditary bundle branch system defect; Lenegre Lev disease; Lev-Lengre disease; Lev syndrome; Lev's disease; PCCD; progressive cardiac conduction defect),"The prevalence of progressive familial heart block is unknown. In the United States, about 1 in 5,000 individuals have complete heart block from any cause; worldwide, about 1 in 2,500 individuals have complete heart block.) ",1689,7
What are the genetic changes related to progressive familial heart block ? (Also called: bundle branch block; HBBD; hereditary bundle branch defect; hereditary bundle branch system defect; Lenegre Lev disease; Lev-Lengre disease; Lev syndrome; Lev's disease; PCCD; progressive cardiac conduction defect),"Mutations in the SCN5A and TRPM4 genes cause most cases of progressive familial heart block types IA and IB, respectively. The proteins produced from these genes are channels that allow positively charged atoms (cations) into and out of cells. Both channels are abundant in heart (cardiac) cells and play key roles in these cells' ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. These channels play a major role in signaling the start of each heartbeat, coordinating the contractions of the atria and ventricles, and maintaining a normal heart rhythm.  The SCN5A and TRPM4 gene mutations that cause progressive familial heart block alter the normal function of the channels. As a result of these channel alterations, cardiac cells have difficulty producing and transmitting the electrical signals that are necessary to coordinate normal heartbeats, leading to heart block. Death of these impaired cardiac cells over time can lead to fibrosis, worsening the heart block.  Mutations in other genes, some of which are unknown, account for the remaining cases of progressive familial heart block.) ",1690,7
Is progressive familial heart block inherited ? (Also called: bundle branch block; HBBD; hereditary bundle branch defect; hereditary bundle branch system defect; Lenegre Lev disease; Lev-Lengre disease; Lev syndrome; Lev's disease; PCCD; progressive cardiac conduction defect),"Progressive familial heart block types I and II are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Some people with TRPM4 gene mutations never develop the condition, a situation known as reduced penetrance.  In most cases, an affected person has one parent with progressive familial heart block.)

If you do not have serious symptoms and have a milder type of heart block, you will most likely need to:  - Have regular checkups with your health care provider.  - Check your pulse every day.  - Be aware of your symptoms and know when to call your provider if symptoms change.   If you have second- or third-degree heart block, you may need a pacemaker to help your heart beat regularly.  - A pacemaker is smaller than a deck of cards. It is put inside the skin on your chest. It gives off electrical signals to make your heart beat at a regular rate and rhythm.  - How long you need the pacemaker depends on the type of heart block you have.  - Heart block caused by a heart attack or heart surgery may go away as you recover.  - If medicine is causing heart block, changing medications can fix the problem.

What is (are) Alcohol use and safe drinking ? (Also called: Beer consumption; Wine consumption; Hard liquor consumption; Safe drinking),"Alcohol is one of the most widely used drug substances in the world.  TEEN DRINKING  Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month. This is in spite of the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the U.S.  About 1 in 5 teens are considered ""problem drinkers."" This means that they:  - Get drunk  - Have accidents related to alcohol use  - Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol    THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL  Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them:  - Beer is about 5% alcohol, although some beers can have more.  - Wine is usually 12 to 15% alcohol.  - Hard liquor is about 45% alcohol.    Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.  The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.  Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster.Stronger drinks tend to be absorbed faster.  Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your ""blood alcohol level."" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.  Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The legal limit for blood alcohol usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms:  - 0.05 -- reduced inhibitions  - 0.10 -- slurred speech  - 0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment  - 0.30 -- confusion  - 0.40 -- stupor  - 0.50 -- coma  - 0.60 -- respiratory paralysis and death    You can have symptoms of ""being drunk"" at blood alcohol levels below the legal definition of being drunk. Also, people who drink alcohol frequently may not have symptoms until a higher blood alcohol level is reached.  HEALTH RISKS OF ALCOHOL  Alcohol increases the risk of:  - Alcoholism  - Falls, drownings, and other accidents  - Head, neck, stomach, and breast cancers  - Motor vehicle accidents  - Risky sex behaviors, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  - Suicide and homicide    Drinking during pregnancy can harm the developing baby. Severe birth defects or fetal alcohol syndrome are possible.  RESPONSIBLE DRINKING  If you drink alcohol, it is best to do so in moderation. Moderation means the drinking is not getting you intoxicated (or drunk) and you are drinking no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman and no more than 2 if you are a man. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 ounces of liquor.  Here are some ways to drink responsibly, provided you do not have a drinking problem, are of legal age to drink alcohol, and are not pregnant:  - Never drink alcohol and drive a car.  - If you are going to drink, have a designated driver, or plan an alternative way home, such as a taxi or bus.  - Do not drink on an empty stomach. Snack before and while drinking alcohol.    If you are taking medication, including over-the-counter drugs, check with your doctor before drinking alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of many medicines stronger. It can also interact with other medicines, making them ineffective or dangerous or make you sick.  If alcohol use runs in your family, you may be at increased risk of developing this disease yourself. So, you may want to avoid drinking alcohol altogether.  CALL YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IF:  - You are concerned about your personal alcohol use or that of a family member  - You are interested in more information regarding alcohol use or support groups  - You are unable to reduce or stop your alcohol consumption, in spite of attempts to stop drinking    Other resources include:  - Local Alcoholics Anonymous or Al-anon/Alateen groups  - Local hospitals  - Public or private mental health agencies  - School or work counselors  - Student or employee health centers) ",1699,2

What to do for Allergic reactions ?,"Allergic reactions are common. The immune response that causes an allergic reaction is similar to the response that causes hay fever. Most reactions happen soon after contact with an allergen.  Many allergic reactions are mild, while others can be severe and life-threatening. They can be confined to a small area of the body, or they may affect the entire body. The most severe form is called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock. Allergic reactions occur more often in people who have a family history of allergies.  Substances that don't bother most people (such as venom from bee stings and certain foods, medications, and pollens) can trigger allergic reactions in certain people.  First-time exposure may produce only a mild reaction. Repeated exposures may lead to more serious reactions. Once a person has had an exposure or an allergic reaction (is sensitized), even a very limited exposure to a very small amount of allergen can trigger a severe reaction.  Most severe allergic reactions occur within seconds or minutes after exposure to the allergen. Some reactions can occur after several hours, particularly if the allergen causes a reaction after it has been eaten. In very rare cases, reactions develop after 24 hours.  Anaphylaxis is a sudden and severe allergic reaction that occurs within minutes of exposure. Immediate medical attention is needed for this condition. Without treatment, anaphylaxis can get worse very quickly and lead to death within 15 minutes.) ",1701,6

This will lead to increased bleeding and a more advanced form of gum and jawbone disease known as periodontitis.  Other causes of bleeding gums include:  - Any bleeding disorder  - Brushing too hard  - Hormonal changes during pregnancy  - Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura  - Ill-fitting dentures or other dental appliances  - Improper flossing  - Infection, which can be either tooth- or gum-related  - Leukemia  - Scurvy  - Use of blood thinners  - Vitamin K deficiency) ",1706,6
What to do for Bleeding gums ? (Also called: Gums - bleeding),"Visit the dentist at least once every 6 months for plaque removal. Follow your dentist's home care instructions.  You should brush your teeth gently with a soft-bristle toothbrush at least twice a day. It is best if you can brush after every meal. Your dentist may tell you to rinse with salt water or hydrogen peroxide and water. Do not use mouthwashes that contain alcohol, which can make the problem worse.   Flossing teeth twice a day can prevent plaque from building up. It can help to follow a balanced, healthy diet. Try to avoid snacking between meals and cut down on the carbohydrates you eat.   Other tips:  - Have periodontal exam.  - Avoid the use of tobacco, which aggravates bleeding gums.  - Control gum bleeding by applying pressure directly on the gums with a gauze pad soaked in ice water.  - If you have been diagnosed with a vitamin deficiency, take vitamin supplements.  - Avoid aspirin unless your health care provider has recommended that you take it.  - If side effects of a medicine are causing the irritation, ask your doctor to prescribe a different drug. Never change your medicine without first talking to your doctor.  - Use an oral irrigation device on the low setting to massage the gums.  - See your dentist if your dentures or other dental appliances do not fit well or are causing sore spots on your gums.  - Follow your dentist's instructions on how to brush and floss so you can avoid hurting your gums.)

What is (are) Heart block ? (Also called: AV Block; Arrhythmia; First-degree heart block; Second-degree heart block; Mobitz type 1; Wenckebach's block; Mobitz type II; Third-degree heart block),"Heart block is a problem in the electrical signals in the heart.  Normally, the heart beat starts in an area in the top chambers of the heart (atria). This area is the heart's pacemaker. The electrical signals travel to the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles). This keeps the heart beat steady and regular.   Heart block occurs when the electrical signal is slowed down or does not reach the bottom chambers of the heart. Your heart may beat slowly, or it may skip beats. Heart block may resolve on its own, or it may be permanent and require treatment.  There are three degrees of heart block. First-degree heart block is the mildest type and third-degree is the most severe.  First-degree heart block:  - Rarely has symptoms   Second-degree heart block:  - The electrical impulse may not reach the lower chambers of the heart.  - The heart may miss a beat or beats and may be slow and irregular.  - You may feel dizzy, faint, or have other symptoms.   Third-degree heart block:  - The electrical signal does not move to the lower chambers of the heart. In this case, the lower chambers beat at a much slower rhythm, and the upper and lower chambers do not beat at the same rate.  - The heart fails to pump enough blood to the body. This can lead to fainting and shortness of breath.  - This is an emergency that needs medical help right away.) ",1730,7

(Also called: Sclerotherapy; Laser therapy - varicose veins; Radiofrequency vein ablation; Endovenous thermal ablation; Ambulatory phlebectomy; Transilluminated power phlebotomy; Endovenous laser ablation; Varicose vein therapy),"Varicose veins most often develop in the legs. They often stick out and are blue in color.  - Normally, valves in your veins keep your blood flowing up toward the heart, so the blood does not collect in one place.  - The valves in varicose veins are either damaged or missing. This causes the veins to become filled with blood, especially when you are standing.    The following treatments for varicose veins can be done in a health care provider's office or clinic. You will receive local anesthesia to numb your leg. You will be awake, but will not feel pain.  Sclerotherapy works best for spider veins. These are small varicose veins.  - Salt water (saline) or a chemical solution is injected into the varicose vein.  - The vein will harden and then disappear.    Laser treatment can be used on the surface of the skin. Small bursts of light make small varicose veins disappear.  Phlebectomy treats surface varicose veins. Very small cuts are made near the damaged vein. Then the vein is removed. One method uses a light under the skin to guide treatment.   This may be done along with other procedures, such as ablation.  Ablation uses intense heat to treat the vein. There are two methods. One uses radiofrequency energy and the other uses laser energy. During these procedures:  - Your doctor will puncture the varicose vein.  - Your doctor will thread a flexible tube (catheter) through the vein up to your groin.  - The catheter will send intense heat to the vein. The heat will close off and destroy the vein and the vein will disappear over time.) ",1736,6

how can botulism be prevented?,"Many cases of botulism are preventable. Foodborne botulism has often been from home-canned foods with low acid content, such as asparagus, green beans, beets and corn and is caused by failure to follow proper canning methods. However, seemingly unlikely or unusual sources are found every decade, with the common problem of improper handling during manufacture, at retail, or by consumers; some examples are chopped garlic in oil, canned cheese sauce, chile peppers, tomatoes, carrot juice, and baked potatoes wrapped in foil. In Alaska, foodborne botulism is caused by fermented fish and other aquatic game foods. Persons who do home canning should follow strict hygienic procedures to reduce contamination of foods, and carefully follow instructions on safe home canning including the use of pressure canners/cookers as recommended through county extension services or from the US Department of Agriculture. Oils infused with garlic or herbs should be refrigerated. Potatoes which have been baked while wrapped in aluminum foil should be kept hot until served or refrigerated. Because the botulinum toxin is destroyed by high temperatures, persons who eat home-canned foods should consider boiling the food for 10 minutes before eating it to ensure safety. Wound botulism can be prevented by promptly seeking medical care for infected wounds and by not using injectable street drugs. Most infant botulism cases cannot be prevented because the bacteria that causes this disease is in soil and dust.  The bacteria can be found inside homes on floors, carpet, and countertops even after cleaning.  Honey can contain the bacteria that causes infant botulism so, children less than 12 months old should not be fed honey. Honey is safe for persons 1 year of age and older.) ",1742,4

What causes Arrhythmias ? (Also called: Abnormal heart rhythms; Bradycardia; Tachycardia),"Normally, your heart works as a pump that brings blood to the lungs and the rest of the body.  To help this happen, your heart has an electrical system that makes sure it contracts (squeezes) in an orderly way.  - The electrical impulse that signals your heart to contract begins in the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node). This is your heart's natural pacemaker.  - The signal leaves the SA node and travels through the heart along a set electrical pathway.  - Different nerve messages signal your heart to beat slower or faster.    Arrhythmias are caused by problems with the heart's electrical conduction system.   - Abnormal (extra) signals may occur.  - Electrical signals may be blocked or slowed.  - Electrical signals travel in new or different pathways through the heart.    Some common causes of abnormal heartbeats are:  - Abnormal levels of potassium or other substances in the body  - Heart attack, or a damaged heart muscle from a past heart attack  - Heart disease that is present at birth (congenital)  - Heart failure or an enlarged heart  - Overactive thyroid gland        Watch this video about:   Arrhythmias     Arrhythmias may also be caused by some substances or drugs, including:  - Alcohol, caffeine, or stimulant drugs   - Heart or blood pressure medicines  - Cigarette smoking (nicotine)  - Drugs that mimic the activity of your nervous system  - Medicines used for depression or psychosis    Sometimes medicines used to treat one type of arrhythmia will cause another type of abnormal heart rhythm.   Some of the more common abnormal heart rhythms are:  - Atrial fibrillation or flutter  - Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT)  - Heart block or atrioventricular block  - Multifocal atrial tachycardia  - Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia  - Sick sinus syndrome  - Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia  - Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) ",1752,7

The two most common SSRI medicines are fluoxetine (Prozac) and escitalopram (Lexapro). These are approved to treat depression in teenagers. Prozac is also approved for children age 8 and older.  Another type of antidepressants, called tri-cyclics, is not approved for use in teens.  There are risks and side effects with taking antidepressants. Your teen's provider can help manage these side effects. In a small number of teens, these medicines can make them more depressed and give them more suicidal thoughts. If this happens, you or your teen should talk to the provider right away.  If you, your teen, and your provider decide that your teen will take an antidepressant, make sure that:  - You give it time to work. Finding the right drug and dose can take time. It could take 4 to 6 weeks to get to full effect.  - A psychiatrist, or other medical doctor, who treats depression in teens is watching for side effects.  - You and other caregivers watch your teen for suicidal thoughts or behaviors, and for nervousness, irritability, moodiness, or sleeplessness that is getting worse. Get medical help for these symptoms right away.  - Your teen does not stop taking the antidepressant on their own. Talk to your teen's provider first. If your teen decides to stop taking the antidepressant, your teen may be instructed to lower the dose slowly before stopping altogether.  - Keep your teen going to talk therapy.  - If your teen is depressed in the fall or winter, ask your doctor about light therapy. It uses a special lamp that acts like the sun and may help with depression.) ",1759,1

What is (are) Vaginal dryness alternative treatments ? (Also called: Alternative treatments for vaginal dryness),"Question:   Is there a drug-free treatment for vaginal dryness?     There are many causes of vaginal dryness. It may be caused by reduced estrogen levels, infection, medicines, and other things. Before treating yourself, talk to your health care provider.   Water-based lubricants and vaginal moisturizers work very well. Lubricants will moisten the vaginal opening and lining for several hours. The effects of a vaginal cream can last for up to a day.  Soybeans contain plant-based substances called isoflavones. These substances have an effect of the body that is similar to estrogen, but weaker. Therefore, it would seem that a diet rich in soy foods would improve symptoms of vaginal dryness. There continues to be research in this area, but the ideal sources or dose is still unknown. Soy foods include tofu, soy milk, and whole soybeans (also called edamame).  Many women claim that creams containing wild yam help with vaginal dryness. However, there is no good research that has evaluated these creams. Also, extracts of wild yam have not been found to have estrogen- or progesterone-like activities. Some of the products may have synthetic medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) added. MPA is a derivative of progesterone, and is also used in oral contraceptives. Like all supplements, MPA-containing products should be used with caution.  Black cohosh is an herb that some women use as a dietary supplement to relieve menopausal symptoms. However, it is not known if this herb helps with vaginal dryness.) ",1762,2

What is (are) alternating hemiplegia of childhood ? (Also called: alternating hemiplegia syndrome),"Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is a neurological condition characterized by recurrent episodes of temporary paralysis, often affecting one side of the body (hemiplegia). During some episodes, the paralysis alternates from one side of the body to the other or affects both sides at the same time. These episodes begin in infancy or early childhood, usually before 18 months of age, and the paralysis lasts from minutes to days.  In addition to paralysis, affected individuals can have sudden attacks of uncontrollable muscle activity; these can cause involuntary limb movements (choreoathetosis), muscle tensing (dystonia), movement of the eyes (nystagmus), or shortness of breath (dyspnea). People with alternating hemiplegia of childhood may also experience sudden redness and warmth (flushing) or unusual paleness (pallor) of the skin. These attacks can occur during or separately from episodes of hemiplegia.  The episodes of hemiplegia or uncontrolled movements can be triggered by certain factors, such as stress, extreme tiredness, cold temperatures, or bathing, although the trigger is not always known. A characteristic feature of alternating hemiplegia of childhood is that all symptoms disappear while the affected person is sleeping but can reappear shortly after awakening. The number and length of the episodes initially worsen throughout childhood but then begin to decrease over time. The uncontrollable muscle movements may disappear entirely, but the episodes of hemiplegia occur throughout life.  Alternating hemiplegia of childhood also causes mild to severe cognitive problems. Almost all affected individuals have some level of developmental delay and intellectual disability. Their cognitive functioning typically declines over time.) ",1765,10
How many people are affected by alternating hemiplegia of childhood ? (Also called: alternating hemiplegia syndrome),Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is a rare condition that affects approximately 1 in 1 million people.) ,1766,10
What are the genetic changes related to alternating hemiplegia of childhood ? (Also called: alternating hemiplegia syndrome),"Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is primarily caused by mutations in the ATP1A3 gene. Very rarely, a mutation in the ATP1A2 gene is involved in the condition. These genes provide instructions for making very similar proteins. They function as different forms of one piece, the alpha subunit, of a larger protein complex called Na+/K+ ATPase; the two versions of the complex are found in different parts of the brain. Both versions play a critical role in the normal function of nerve cells (neurons). Na+/K+ ATPase transports charged atoms (ions) into and out of neurons, which is an essential part of the signaling process that controls muscle movement.  Mutations in the ATP1A3 or ATP1A2 gene reduce the activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase, impairing its ability to transport ions normally. It is unclear how a malfunctioning Na+/K+ ATPase causes the episodes of paralysis or uncontrollable movements characteristic of alternating hemiplegia of childhood.) ",1767,5
Is alternating hemiplegia of childhood inherited ? (Also called: alternating hemiplegia syndrome),"Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is considered an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases of alternating hemiplegia of childhood result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. However, the condition can also run in families. For unknown reasons, the signs and symptoms are typically milder when the condition is found in multiple family members than when a single individual is affected.) ",1768,7

What is (are) Huntington disease-like syndrome ? (Also called: Huntington disease-like syndromes; Huntington's disease-like syndromes; Huntington's disease phenocopies; Huntington's disease phenocopy syndromes),"As its name suggests, a Huntington disease-like (HDL) syndrome is a condition that resembles Huntington disease. Researchers have described four HDL syndromes, designated Huntington disease-like 1 (HDL1) through Huntington disease-like 4 (HDL4). These progressive brain disorders are characterized by uncontrolled movements, emotional problems, and loss of thinking ability. HDL syndromes occur in people with the characteristic features of Huntington disease who do not have a mutation in HD, the gene typically associated with that disorder.  HDL1, HDL2, and HDL4 usually appear in early to mid-adulthood, although they can begin earlier in life. The first signs and symptoms of these conditions often include irritability, emotional problems, small involuntary movements, poor coordination, and trouble learning new information or making decisions. Many affected people develop involuntary jerking or twitching movements known as chorea. As the disease progresses, these abnormal movements become more pronounced. Affected individuals may develop problems with walking, speaking, and swallowing. People with these disorders also experience changes in personality and a decline in thinking and reasoning abilities. Individuals with an HDL syndrome can live for a few years to more than a decade after signs and symptoms begin.  HDL3 begins much earlier in life than most of the other HDL syndromes (usually around age 3 or 4). Affected children experience a decline in thinking ability, difficulties with movement and speech, and seizures. Because HDL3 has a somewhat different pattern of signs and symptoms and a different pattern of inheritance, researchers are unsure whether it belongs in the same category as the other HDL syndromes.)

"What is (are) hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness ? (Also called: HID syndrome; ichthyosis, hystrix-like, with deafness)","Hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness (HID) is a disorder characterized by dry, scaly skin (ichthyosis) and hearing loss that is usually profound. Hystrix-like means resembling a porcupine; in this type of ichthyosis, the scales may be thick and spiky, giving the appearance of porcupine quills.  Newborns with HID typically develop reddened skin. The skin abnormalities worsen over time, and the ichthyosis eventually covers most of the body, although the palms of the hands and soles of the feet are usually only mildly affected. Breaks in the skin may occur and in severe cases can lead to life-threatening infections. Affected individuals have an increased risk of developing a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma, which can also affect mucous membranes such as the inner lining of the mouth. People with HID may also have patchy hair loss caused by scarring on particular areas of skin.) ",1771,3
"What are the genetic changes related to hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness ? (Also called: HID syndrome; ichthyosis, hystrix-like, with deafness)","HID is caused by mutations in the GJB2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called gap junction beta 2, more commonly known as connexin 26. Connexin 26 is a member of the connexin protein family. Connexin proteins form channels called gap junctions that permit the transport of nutrients, charged atoms (ions), and signaling molecules between neighboring cells that are in contact with each other. Gap junctions made with connexin 26 transport potassium ions and certain small molecules.  Connexin 26 is found in cells throughout the body, including the inner ear and the skin. In the inner ear, channels made from connexin 26 are found in a snail-shaped structure called the cochlea. These channels may help to maintain the proper level of potassium ions required for the conversion of sound waves to electrical nerve impulses. This conversion is essential for normal hearing. In addition, connexin 26 may be involved in the maturation of certain cells in the cochlea. Connexin 26 also plays a role in the growth and maturation of the outermost layer of skin (the epidermis).  At least one GJB2 gene mutation has been identified in people with HID. This mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in connexin 26. The mutation is thought to result in channels that constantly leak ions, which impairs the health of the cells and increases cell death. Death of cells in the skin and the inner ear may underlie the signs and symptoms of HID.  Because the GJB2 gene mutation identified in people with HID also occurs in keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome (KID syndrome), a disorder with similar features and the addition of eye abnormalities, many researchers categorize KID syndrome and HID as a single disorder, which they call KID/HID. It is not known why some people with this mutation have eye problems while others do not.) ",1772,7

What is (are) nephronophthisis ? (Also called: NPH; NPHP),"Nephronophthisis is a disorder that affects the kidneys. It is characterized by inflammation and scarring (fibrosis) that impairs kidney function. These abnormalities lead to increased urine production (polyuria), excessive thirst (polydipsia), general weakness, and extreme tiredness (fatigue). In addition, affected individuals develop fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys, usually in an area known as the corticomedullary region. Another feature of nephronophthisis is a shortage of red blood cells, a condition known as anemia.  Nephronophthisis eventually leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a life-threatening failure of kidney function that occurs when the kidneys are no longer able to filter fluids and waste products from the body effectively. Nephronophthisis can be classified by the approximate age at which ESRD begins: around age 1 (infantile), around age 13 (juvenile), and around age 19 (adolescent).  About 85 percent of all cases of nephronophthisis are isolated, which means they occur without other signs and symptoms. Some people with nephronophthisis have additional features, which can include liver fibrosis, heart abnormalities, or mirror image reversal of the position of one or more organs inside the body (situs inversus).  Nephronophthisis can occur as part of separate syndromes that affect other areas of the body; these are often referred to as nephronophthisis-associated ciliopathies. For example, Senior-Lken syndrome is characterized by the combination of nephronophthisis and a breakdown of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retinal degeneration); Joubert syndrome affects many parts of the body, causing neurological problems and other features, which can include nephronophthisis.)

What is (are) Depression ?,"Everyone feels blue or sad now and then, but these feelings don't usually last long and pass within a couple of days. When a person has depression, it interferes with daily life and normal functioning, and causes pain for both the person with depression and those who care about him or her. Doctors call this condition ""depressive disorder,"" or ""clinical depression."" Depression in Older Adults Important life changes that happen as we get older may cause feelings of uneasiness, stress, and sadness. For instance, the death of a loved one, moving from work into retirement, or dealing with a serious illness can leave people feeling sad or anxious. After a period of adjustment, many older adults can regain their emotional balance, but others do not and may develop depression. Depression is a common problem among older adults, but it is NOT a normal part of aging. In fact, studies show that most older adults feel satisfied with their lives, despite having more physical ailments. However, when older adults do suffer from depression, it may be overlooked because they may be less willing to talk about feelings of sadness or grief, or they may show different, less obvious symptoms, and doctors may be less likely to suspect or spot it. Sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish grief from major depression. Grief after loss of a loved one is a normal reaction to the loss and generally does not require professional mental health treatment. However, grief that lasts for a very long time following a loss may require treatment. Test Depression and Suicide Though it is widely believed that suicide more often affects young people, suicide is a serious problem among older adults, too  particularly among older men  and depression is usually a major contributing factor. Adults 65 and older have a suicide rate that is higher than the rate for the national population, but there are some major differences between older men and women. While suicide rates for older women are somewhat lower than those for young and middle-aged women, rates among men 75 and older are higher than those for younger men. In fact, white men age 85 and older have the highest suicide rate in the United States. Types of Depression There are several types of depression.

Travelers should take the following steps to protect against getting the disease:  - Avoid dairy products.  - Avoid raw or undercooked meat and fish.  - Beware of sliced fruit that may have been washed in unclean water. Travelers should peel all fresh fruits and vegetables themselves.  - DO NOT buy food from street vendors.  - Get vaccinated against hepatitis A (and possibly hepatitis B) if traveling to countries where outbreaks of the disease occur.  - Use only carbonated bottled water for brushing teeth and drinking. (Remember that ice cubes can carry infection.)  - If bottled water is not available, boiling water is the best way to get rid of hepatitis A.

What is (are) Lead Poisoning ? (Also called: Plumbism),"Lead is a metal that occurs naturally in the earth's crust. Lead can be found in all parts of our environment. Much of it comes from human activities such as mining and manufacturing. Lead used to be in paint; older houses may still have lead paint. You could be exposed to lead by       - Eating food or drinking water that contains lead. Water pipes in older homes may contain lead.    - Working in a job where lead is used    - Using lead in a hobby, such as making stained glass or lead-glazed pottery    - Using folk remedies such as herbs or foods that contain lead       Breathing air, drinking water, eating food, or swallowing or touching dirt that contains lead can cause many health problems. Lead can affect almost every organ and system in your body. In adults, lead can increase blood pressure and cause infertility, nerve disorders, and muscle and joint pain. It can also make you irritable and affect your ability to concentrate and remember.    Lead is especially dangerous for children. A child who swallows large amounts of lead may develop anemia, severe stomachache, muscle weakness, and brain damage. Even at low levels, lead can affect a child's mental and physical growth.

Drinking raw milk has also caused infection in rare cases. People at highest risk for this infection are:  - Farmers  - Laboratory workers who work with Coxiella burnetii  - Sheep and dairy workers  - Veterinarians    People at highest risk include those with heart valve problems or weakened immune systems.) ,1921,2
What causes Q fever - early ?,"Q fever is caused by the bacteria Coxiella burnetii, which live in domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, birds, and cats. Some wild animals and ticks also carry the bacteria.  You can get Q fever by drinking raw (unpasteurized) milk, or afterbreathing indust or droplets in the air that are contaminated with infected animal feces, blood, or birth products.  Symptoms usually develop 2 to 3 weeks after coming in contact with the bacteria. This timeis called the incubation period. Most people have no symptoms. Others may have moderately severe symptoms similar to the flu. If symptoms occur, they may last for several weeks.  People at risk for infection include slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians, researchers, food processors, and sheep and cattle workers. Men are infected more often than women. Most people who get Q fever are between 30 and 70 years old.  This disease is occasionally seen in children, especially those who live on a farm. In infected children younger than 3 years old, Q fever is usually discovered while looking for the cause of pneumonia.) ",1922,2

Your provider will do a physical exam.   - If you have appendicitis, your pain will increase when your lower right belly area is pressed.  - If your appendix has ruptured, touching the belly area may cause a lot of pain and lead you to tighten your muscles.  - A rectal exam may find tenderness on the right side of your rectum.    A blood test will often show a high white blood cell count. Imaging tests may also help diagnose appendicitis. Imaging tests include:  - CT scan of the abdomen  - Ultrasound of the abdomen) ",1927,5
What are the treatments for Appendicitis ?,"Most of the time, a surgeon will remove your appendix as soon as you are diagnosed.   If a CT scan shows that you have an abscess, you may be treated with antibiotics first. You will have your appendix removed after the infection and swelling have gone away.  The tests used to diagnose appendicitis are not perfect. As a result, the operation may show that your appendix is normal. In that case, the surgeonwill remove your appendix and explore the rest of your abdomen for other causes of your pain.) ",1928,8

What to do for Fever ? (Also called: Elevated temperature; Hyperthermia; Pyrexia),"Normal body temperature may change during any given day. It is usually highest in the evening. Other factors that may affect body temperature are:  - A woman's menstrual cycle. In the second part of this cycle, her temperature may go up by 1 degree or more.  - Physical activity, strong emotion, eating, heavy clothing, medications, high room temperature, and high humidity can all increase body temperature.    Fever is an important part of the body's defense against infection. Most bacteria and viruses that cause infections in people thrive best at 98.6F. Many infants and children develop high fevers with mild viral illnesses. Although a fever signals that a battle might be going on in the body, the fever is fighting for, not against the person.  Brain damage from a fever generally will not occur unless the fever is over 107.6F (42C). Untreated fevers caused by infection will seldom go over 105F unless the child is overdressed or trapped in a hot place.  Febrile seizures do occur in some children. Most febrile seizures are over quickly and do not mean your child has epilepsy. These seizures also do not cause any permanent harm.  Unexplained fevers that continue for days or weeks are called fevers of undetermined origin (FUO).) ",1933,2
What to do for Fever ? (Also called: Elevated temperature; Hyperthermia; Pyrexia),"A simple cold or other viral infection can sometimes cause a high fever (102 - 104F, or 38.9 - 40C). This does not usually mean you or your child has a serious problem. Some serious infections may not cause a fever, or may even cause a very low body temperature, especially in infants.  If the fever is mild and you have no other problems, you do not need treatment. Drink fluids and rest.  The illness is probably not serious if your child:  - Is still interested in playing  - Is eating and drinking well  - Is alert and smiling at you  - Has a normal skin color  - Looks well when their temperature comes down    Take steps to lower a fever if you or your child is uncomfortable, vomiting, dried out (dehydrated), or not sleeping well. Remember, the goal is to lower, not eliminate, the fever.  When trying to lower a fever:  - Do not bundle up someone who has the chills.  - Remove excess clothing or blankets. The room should be comfortable, not too hot or cool. Try one layer of lightweight clothing, and one lightweight blanket for sleep. If the room is hot or stuffy, a fan may help.  - A lukewarm bath or sponge bath may help cool someone with a fever. This is especially effective after medication is given -- otherwise the temperature might bounce right back up.  - Donot use cold baths, ice, or alcohol rubs. These cool the skin, but often make the situation worse by causing shivering, which raises the core body temperature.    Here are some guidelines for taking medicine to lower a fever:  - Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help reduce fever in children and adults. Sometimes doctors advise you to use both types of medicine.  - Take acetaminophen every 4 to 6 hours. It works by turning down the brain's thermostat.  - Take ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours. Do not use ibuprofen in children 6 months or younger.  - Aspirin is very effective for treating fever in adults. Do not give aspirin to a child unless your child's doctor tells you to.  - Know how much you or your child weighs, and then always check the instructions on the package to find the correct dose.  - In children 3 months or younger, call your doctor first before giving medicines.    Eating and drinking:  - Everyone, especially children, should drink plenty of fluids. Water, popsicles, soup, and gelatin are all good choices.  - Do not give too much fruit juice or apple juice and avoid sports drinks in younger children.  - Although eating is fine, do not force foods.)

What are the symptoms of Appendicitis ?,"The symptoms of appendicitis can vary. It can be hard to diagnose appendicitis in young children, the elderly, and women of childbearing age.  The first symptom is often pain around the belly button. Pain may be minor at first, but becomes more sharp and severe. You may also have a loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and a low fever.  The pain tends to move into the right lower part of your belly. The pain tends to focus at a spot directly above the appendix called McBurney's point. This most often occurs 12 to 24 hours after the illness starts.  If your appendix breaks open (ruptures), you may have less pain for a short time and you may feel better. However, the pain soon gets worse and you will feel sicker.  Your pain may be worse when you walk, cough, or make sudden movements. Later symptoms include:  - Chills and shaking  - Hard stools  - Diarrhea  - Fever  - Nausea and vomiting) ",1939,6
What is (are) Appendicitis ?,"The appendix is a small, tube-like organ attached to the first part of the large intestine. It is located in the lower right part of the abdomen. It has no known function. A blockage inside of the appendix causes appendicitis. The blockage leads to increased pressure, problems with blood flow, and inflammation. If the blockage is not treated, the appendix can burst and spread infection into the abdomen. This causes a condition called peritonitis.    The main symptom is pain in the abdomen, often on the right side. It is usually sudden and gets worse over time. Other symptoms may include       -  Swelling in the abdomen    -  Loss of appetite    -  Nausea and vomiting    -  Constipation or diarrhea    -  Inability to pass gas    -  Low fever        Not everyone with appendicitis has all these symptoms.

What are the treatments for Substance use - prescription drugs ? (Also called: Substance use disorder - prescription drugs; Substance abuse - prescription drugs; Drug abuse - prescription drugs; Drug use - prescription drugs),"Treatment begins with recognizing there is aproblem. Once you decide you want to do something about your drug use, the next step is to get help and support.  Treatment programs use behavior modification techniques through counseling (talk therapy). The techniques get you to understand your behaviors and why you use drugs. Involving family and friends during counseling can help support you keep you from going back to using (relapsing).  With some drug addictions, such as opioids, medicines may also be used to help reduce the effects of opioids on the brain. Other medicines may be used to lessen cravings and withdrawal symptoms.  If you have severe withdrawal symptoms, you may need to stay at a residential treatment program. There, your health and safety can be monitored as you recover.) ",1948,1
Do I need to see a doctor for Substance use - prescription drugs ?

This test tells how much 5-HIAA the body is producing. It is also a way to measure how much serotonin is in the body.,1951,5
What is (are) myasthenia gravis ? (Also called: MG),"Myasthenia gravis is a disorder that causes weakness of the skeletal muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. The weakness most often starts in the muscles around the eyes, causing drooping of the eyelids (ptosis) and difficulty coordinating eye movements, which results in blurred or double vision. In a form of the disorder called ocular myasthenia, the weakness remains confined to the eye muscles. In most people with myasthenia gravis, however, additional muscles in the face and neck are affected. Affected individuals may have unusual facial expressions, difficulty holding up the head, speech impairment (dysarthria), and chewing and swallowing problems (dysphagia) that may lead to choking, gagging, or drooling.  Other muscles in the body are also affected in some people with myasthenia gravis. The muscles of the arms and legs may be involved, causing affected individuals to have changes in their gait or trouble with lifting objects, rising from a seated position, or climbing stairs. The muscle weakness tends to fluctuate over time; it typically worsens with activity and improves with rest.  Weakness of the muscles in the chest wall and the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm) can cause breathing problems in some people with myasthenia gravis. About 10 percent of people with this disorder experience a potentially life-threatening complication in which these respiratory muscles weaken to the point that breathing is dangerously impaired, and the affected individual requires ventilation assistance. This respiratory failure, called a myasthenic crisis, may be triggered by stresses such as infections or reactions to medications.  People can develop myasthenia gravis at any age. For reasons that are unknown, it is most commonly diagnosed in women younger than age 40 and men older than age 60. It is uncommon in children, but some infants born to women with myasthenia gravis show signs and symptoms of the disorder for the first few days or weeks of life. This temporary occurrence of symptoms is called transient neonatal myasthenia gravis.) ",1952,6
How many people are affected by myasthenia gravis ? (Also called: MG),"Myasthenia gravis affects about 20 per 100,000 people worldwide. The prevalence has been increasing in recent decades, which likely results from earlier diagnosis and better treatments leading to longer lifespans for affected individuals.) ",1953,3
What are the genetic changes related to myasthenia gravis ? (Also called: MG),"Researchers believe that variations in particular genes may increase the risk of myasthenia gravis, but the identity of these genes is unknown. Many factors likely contribute to the risk of developing this complex disorder.  Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder, which occurs when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. In myasthenia gravis, the immune system disrupts the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles by producing a protein called an antibody that attaches (binds) to proteins important for nerve signal transmission. Antibodies normally bind to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction, but the antibody in myasthenia gravis attacks a normal human protein. In most affected individuals, the antibody targets a protein called acetylcholine receptor (AChR); in others, the antibodies attack a related protein called muscle-specific kinase (MuSK). In both cases, the abnormal antibodies lead to a reduction of available AChR.  The AChR protein is critical for signaling between nerve and muscle cells, which is necessary for movement. In myasthenia gravis, because of the abnormal immune response, less AChR is present, which reduces signaling between nerve and muscle cells. These signaling abnormalities lead to decreased muscle movement and the muscle weakness characteristic of this condition.  It is unclear why the immune system malfunctions in people with myasthenia gravis. About 75 percent of affected individuals have an abnormally large and overactive thymus, which is a gland located behind the breastbone that plays an important role in the immune system. The thymus sometimes develops tumors (thymomas) that are usually noncancerous (benign). However, the relationship between the thymus problems and the specific immune system malfunction that occurs in myasthenia gravis is not well understood.  People with myasthenia gravis are at increased risk of developing other autoimmune disorders, including autoimmune thyroid disease and systemic lupus erythematosus. Gene variations that affect immune system function likely affect the risk of developing myasthenia gravis and other autoimmune disorders.  Some families are affected by an inherited disorder with symptoms similar to those of myasthenia gravis, but in which antibodies to the AChR or MuSK proteins are not present. This condition, which is not an autoimmune disorder, is called congenital myasthenic syndrome.) ",1954,6
Is myasthenia gravis inherited ? (Also called: MG),"In most cases, myasthenia gravis is not inherited and occurs in people with no history of the disorder in their family. About 3 to 5 percent of affected individuals have other family members with myasthenia gravis or other autoimmune disorders, but the inheritance pattern is unknown.) ",1955,7
How should Oxybutynin Topical be used and what is the dosage ?,"Topical oxybutynin comes as a gel to apply to the skin. It is usually applied once a day. Apply oxybutynin gel at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.

Oxybutynin gel may help control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Continue to use oxybutynin gel even if you feel well. Do not stop using oxybutynin gel without talking to your doctor.  Oxybutynin gel is only for use on the skin. Do not swallow oxybutynin gel and be careful not to get the medication in your eyes. If you get oxybutynin gel in your eyes, wash them with warm, clean water right away. Call your doctor if your eyes become irritated.  You can apply oxybutynin gel anywhere on your shoulders, upper arms, stomach, or thighs. Choose a different area to apply your medication every day, and apply the entire dose to the place you choose. Do not apply oxybutynin gel to your breasts or your genital area. Do not apply the medication to skin that has recently been shaved or that has open sores, rashes, or tattoos.  Keep the area where you applied oxybutynin gel dry for at least 1 hour after you apply the medication. Do not swim, bathe, shower, exercise, or get the area wet during this time. You may apply sunscreen during your treatment with oxybutynin gel.  Oxybutynin gel may catch fire. Stay away from open flames and do not smoke while you are applying the medication and until it is completely dry.  Oxybutynin gel comes in a pump that dispenses measured amounts of the medication and in single dose packets. If you are using the pump, you will have to prime it before the first use. To prime the pump, hold the container upright and press the top down completely 4 times. Do not use any medication that comes out when you are priming the pump. To use oxybutynin gel, follow these steps:   - Wash the area where you plan to apply the medication with mild soap and water. Allow it to dry.  - Wash your hands.  - If you are using the pump, hold the pump upright and press down on the top three times. You can hold the pump so that the medication comes out directly onto the area where you want to apply it, or you can dispense the medication onto your palm and apply it to your chosen area with your fingers.  - If you are using the single dose packets, tear one packet at the notch to open it. Squeeze all of the medication out of the packet. The amount of medication that you squeeze out of the packet should be about the size of a nickel. You can squeeze the medication directly onto the area where you plan to apply it, or you can squeeze it onto your palm and apply it to your chosen area with your fingers. Throw away the empty packet in a trash can that is out of the reach of children.  - Wash your hands again.

How should Oxybutynin Transdermal Patch be used and what is the dosage ?,"Transdermal oxybutynin comes as a patch to apply to the skin. It is usually applied twice each week (every 34 days). You should apply transdermal oxybutynin on the same 2 days of the week every week. To help you remember to apply your patches on the right days, you should mark the calendar on the back of your package of medication. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use transdermal oxybutynin exactly as directed. Do not apply the patches more often than prescribed by your doctor.  You can apply oxybutynin patches anywhere on your stomach, hips, or buttocks except the area around your waistline. Choose an area where you think the patch will be comfortable for you, where it will not be rubbed by tight clothing, and where it will be protected from sunlight by clothing. After you apply a patch to a particular area, wait at least 1 week before applying another patch in that spot. Do not apply patches to skin that has wrinkles or folds; that you have recently treated with any lotion, oil, or powder; or that is oily, cut, scraped, or irritated. Before applying a patch, be sure the skin is clean and dry.  After you apply an oxybutynin patch, you should wear it all the time until you are ready to remove it and put on a fresh patch. If the patch loosens or falls off before it is time to replace it, try to press it back in place with your fingers. If the patch cannot be pressed back on, throw it away and apply a fresh patch to a different area. Replace the fresh patch on your next scheduled patch change day.  You may bathe, swim, shower, or exercise while you are wearing an oxybutynin patch. However, try not to rub on the patch during these activities, and do not soak in a hot tub for a long period of time while wearing a patch.  Transdermal oxybutynin controls the symptoms of overactive bladder but does not cure the condition. Continue to take transdermal oxybutynin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking transdermal oxybutynin without talking to your doctor. To use the patches, follow these steps:   - Open the protective pouch and remove the patch.  - Peel the first piece of liner off the sticky side of the patch. A second strip of liner should remain stuck to the patch.  - Press the patch firmly onto your skin with the sticky side down. Be careful not to touch the sticky side with your fingers.  - Bend the patch in half and use your fingertips to roll the remaining part of the patch onto your skin. The second liner strip should fall off of the patch when you do this.  - Press firmly on the surface of the patch to attach it tightly to your skin.  - When you are ready to remove a patch, peel it off slowly and gently. Fold the patch in half with the sticky sides together and throw it away in a trash can that is out of reach of children and pets. Children and pets can be harmed if they chew on, play with, or wear used patches.  - Wash the area that was under the patch with mild soap and warm water to remove any residue. If necessary, you can use baby oil or a medical adhesive removal pad to remove residue that will not come off with soap and water. Do not use alcohol, nail polish remover, or other solvents.  - Apply a new patch to a different area immediately by following steps 15.) ",1958,10

How effective is 5-HTP ?,"Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.  The effectiveness ratings for 5-HTP are as follows: Possibly effective for...  - Depression. Research shows that taking 5-HTP by mouth might improve symptoms of depression. Several trials have found that doses of 50-3000 mg daily for 2-4 weeks can improve symptoms of depression. Some early research also shows that 5-HTP might be as beneficial as conventional antidepressant therapy.   - Fibromyalgia. Taking 5-HTP by mouth appears to improve symptoms of fibromyalgia including pain severity, morning stiffness, and sleeplessness.  Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...    - Alcoholism. Early research shows that taking 5-HTP with D-phenylalanine and L-glutamine for 40 days can reduce alcohol withdrawal symptoms. However, taking 5-HTP with carbidopa daily for one year does not seem to help people stop drinking. The effect of 5-HTP alone for alcoholism is not clear.   - Alzheimer's disease. Early research suggests that taking 5-HTP by mouth does not help symptoms of Alzheimers disease.   - Anxiety. Evidence on the effects of 5-HTP for anxiety is unclear. Taking up to 300 mg of 5-HTP daily along with carbidopa seems to reduce anxiety symptoms in people with anxiety disorders. However, taking 60 mg of 5-HTP daily through the vein does not reduce anxiety in people with panic disorders.   - Nervous system disorder (Cerebellar ataxia). Evidence on the use of 5-HTP for cerebellar ataxia is unclear. Early evidence shows that taking 5 mg/kg of 5-HTP daily for 4 months can decrease nervous system dysfunction. However, other research shows that taking 5-HTP daily for up to one year does not improve symptoms of cerebellar ataxia.   - Down syndrome. Taking 2 mg/kg of 5-HTP daily for 3 years does not improve muscle movement, social skills, or intellectual development in newborn children with Down syndrome.   - Headache. Evidence on the use of 5-HTP to prevent or treat headache symptoms is unclear. Some research shows that taking 5-HTP daily can reduce headache symptoms in children with headaches. However, other studies show that 5-HTP does not reduce the number or severity of headaches.   - Insomnia. Taking an amino acid formula (Gabadone) containing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and 5-HTP seems to help people with sleeping problems fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. The effect of 5-HTP alone on sleeping problems is unclear.   - Menopausal symptoms. Taking 150 mg of 5-HTP daily for 4 weeks does not reduce hot flashes in postmenopausal women.   - Migraine headache. Evidence on the effects of 5-HTP for the prevention or treatment of migraines in adults is unclear. Some studies show that taking 5-HTP daily does not reduce migraines, while other studies show that it might be as beneficial as prescription drugs. 5-HTP does not seem to reduce migraines in children.   - Obesity. Early research suggests that taking 5-HTP might help reduce appetite, caloric intake, and weight in obese people.   - Muscle spasms in the mouth (Palatal myoclonus). Early evidence suggests that taking 5-HTP by mouth might reduce muscle spasms in people with palatal myoclonus.   - Premenstrual syndrome (PMS).   - Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).   - Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).   - Other conditions.   More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of 5-HTP for these uses.) ",1962,1
What is the dosage of 5-HTP ?,"The appropriate dose of 5-HTP depends on several factors such as the user's age, health, and several other conditions. At this time there is not enough scientific information to determine an appropriate range of doses for 5-HTP.

A second strip of liner should remain stuck to the patch.  - Press the patch firmly onto your skin with the sticky side down. Be careful not to touch the sticky side with your fingers.  - Bend the patch in half and use your fingertips to roll the remaining part of the patch onto your skin. The second liner strip should fall off of the patch when you do this.  - Press firmly on the surface of the patch to attach it tightly to your skin.  - When you are ready to remove a patch, peel it off slowly and gently. Fold the patch in half with the sticky sides together and throw it away in a trash can that is out of reach of children and pets. Children and pets can be harmed if they chew on, play with, or wear used patches.  - Wash the area that was under the patch with mild soap and warm water to remove any residue. If necessary, you can use baby oil or a medical adhesive removal pad to remove residue that will not come off with soap and water. Do not use alcohol, nail polish remover, or other solvents.  - Apply a new patch to a different area immediately by following steps 15.) ",1972,10

What causes Breathing difficulty ? (Also called: Shortness of breath; Breathlessness; Difficulty breathing; Dyspnea),"Shortness of breath has many different causes. For example, heart disease can cause breathlessness if your heart is unable to pump enough blood to supply oxygen to your body. If your brain, muscles, or other body organs do not get enough oxygen, a sense of breathlessness may occur.  Breathing difficulty may also be due to problems with the lungs, airways, or other health problems.

What is (are) Separation anxiety in children ?,Separation anxiety in children is a developmental stage during which the child experiences anxiety when separated from the primary caregiver (usually the mother).) ,1980,5
What causes Separation anxiety in children ?,"As infants develop, they experience various emotions, usually in a predictable order. Before 8 months, infants are so new to the world that they have little knowledge of what is ordinary and what may be dangerous, so new situations or experiences seem usual, and not frightening.  In normal development, during this early period the infant becomes familiar with the home environment, and feels comfortable when parents or other known caretakers are present. After this time, lack of familiarity often produces fear because the infant recognizes that something unusual is going on.  From 8to 14 months, children often become frightened when they meet new people or visit new places. They recognize their parents as familiar and safe. When separated from their parents, particularly when away from home, they feel threatened and unsafe.  Separation anxiety is a normal developmental stage. It helped keep our ancestors alive and helps children learn how to master their environment.  It usually ends when the child is around 2 years old. At this age, toddlers begin to understand that parents may be out of sight now, but will return later. There is also a normal desire to test their independence.  To get over separation anxiety, children must:  - Feel safe in their home environment  - Trust people other than their parents  - Trust that their parents will return   Even after children have successfully mastered this developmental stage, separation anxiety may return during periods of stress. Most children will experience some degree of separation anxiety when in unfamiliar situations, especially when separated from their parents.  When children are in situations (such as hospitals) and are experiencing stress (such as illness or pain), they seek the safety, comfort, and protection of their parents. When parents cannot be with their children in these situations, the children experience distress.  This is why it is important to stay with your child as much as is possible during any medical procedures. Your presence can actually reduce the amount of pain the child experiences, as anxiety of any kind makes pain worse.) ",1981,5

What is (are) Shoulder separation - aftercare ? (Also called: Separated shoulder - aftercare; Acromioclavicular joint separation - aftercare; A/C separation - aftercare),"Most shoulder separation injuries are caused by falling onto the shoulder.

These medications should be taken at evenly spaced times throughout the day and night; no more than 12 hours should pass between doses. The extended-release tablet (Horizant) is taken with food once daily at about 5 PM. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take gabapentin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.  Gabapentin extended-release tablets cannot be substituted for another type of gabapentin product. Be sure that you receive only the type of gabapentin that was prescribed by your doctor. Ask your pharmacist if you have any questions about the type of gabapentin you were given.  Swallow the extended-release tablets whole; do not cut, chew, or crush them.  If your doctor tells you to take one-half of a regular tablet as part of your dose, carefully split the tablet along the score mark. Use the other half-tablet as part of your next dose. Properly throw away any half-tablets that you have not used within several days of breaking them.  If you are taking gabapentin to control seizures or PHN, your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of gabapentin and gradually increase your dose as needed to treat your condition. If you are taking gabapentin to treat PHN, tell your doctor if your symptoms do not improve during your treatment.  Gabapentin may help to control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take gabapentin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking gabapentin without talking to your doctor, even if you experience side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood. If you suddenly stop taking gabapentin tablets, capsules, or oral solution, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, nausea, pain, and sweating. If you are taking gabapentin to treat seizures and you suddenly stop taking the medication, you may experience seizures more often. Your doctor may decrease your dose gradually over at least a week.  Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with gabapentin and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.) ",2008,9

Your child may have sudden changes in mood, become hostile or hyperactive, have difficulty concentrating or paying attention, or be drowsy or clumsy. Have your child avoid activities that could be dangerous, such as riding a bicycle, until you know how gabapentin affects him or her.  - remember that alcohol can add to the drowsiness caused by this medication.  - you should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways and you may become suicidal (thinking about harming or killing yourself or planning or trying to do so) while you are taking gabapentin for the treatment of epilepsy, mental illness, or other conditions. A small number of adults and children 5 years of age and older (about 1 in 500 people) who took anticonvulsants such as gabapentin to treat various conditions during clinical studies became suicidal during their treatment. Some of these people developed suicidal thoughts and behavior as early as one week after they started taking the medication. There is a risk that you may experience changes in your mental health if you take an anticonvulsant medication such as gabapentin, but there may also be a risk that you will experience changes in your mental health if your condition is not treated. You and your doctor will decide whether the risks of taking an anticonvulsant medication are greater than the risks of not taking the medication. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: panic attacks; agitation or restlessness; new or worsening irritability, anxiety, or depression; acting on dangerous impulses; difficulty falling or staying asleep; aggressive, angry, or violent behavior; mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood); talking or thinking about wanting to hurt yourself or end your life; withdrawing from friends and family; preoccupation with death and dying; giving away prized possessions; or any other unusual changes in behavior or mood.

There is a greater risk that you will overuse hydrocodone if you have or have ever had any of these conditions.  Do not allow anyone else to take your medication. Hydrocodone may harm or cause death to other people who take your medication, especially children. Keep hydrocodone in a safe place so that no one else can take it accidentally or on purpose. Be especially careful to keep hydrocodone out of the reach of children. Keep track of how many capsules or tablets are left so you will know if any medication is missing.  Hydrocodone may cause slowed or stopped breathing, especially when you begin your treatment and any time your dose is increased. Your doctor will monitor you carefully during your treatment. Your doctor will adjust your dose to control your pain and decrease the risk that you will experience serious breathing problems. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had slowed breathing or asthma. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take hydrocodone. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; a group of diseases that affect the lungs and airways), a head injury, or any condition that increases the amount of pressure in your brain. The risk that you will develop breathing problems may be higher if you are an older adult or are weakened or malnourished due to disease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: slowed breathing, long pauses between breaths, or shortness of breath.  Drinking alcohol, taking prescription or nonprescription medications that contain alcohol, or using street drugs during your treatment with hydrocodone increases the risk that you will experience breathing problems or other serious, life-threatening side effects. It is especially important that you do not drink any drinks that contain alcohol or take any prescription or non-prescription medications that contain alcohol during your treatment with hydrocodone extended-release capsules and extended-release tablets.

Hydrocodone extended-release capsules and extended-release tablets are difficult to crush, break or dissolve. If you swallow broken, chewed, or crushed extended-release capsules or extended-release tablets, you may receive too much hydrocodone at once. This may cause serious problems, including overdose and death.  Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you take hydrocodone regularly during your pregnancy, your baby may experience life-threatening withdrawal symptoms after birth. Tell your baby's doctor right away if your baby experiences any of the following symptoms: irritability, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep, high-pitched cry, uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body, vomiting, diarrhea, or failure to gain weight.

What is (are) Alcohol use and safe drinking ? (Also called: Beer consumption; Wine consumption; Hard liquor consumption; Safe drinking),"Alcohol is one of the most widely used drug substances in the world.  TEEN DRINKING  Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month. This is in spite of the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the U.S.  About 1 in 5 teens are considered ""problem drinkers."" This means that they:  - Get drunk  - Have accidents related to alcohol use  - Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol    THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL  Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them:  - Beer is about 5% alcohol, although some beers can have more.  - Wine is usually 12 to 15% alcohol.  - Hard liquor is about 45% alcohol.    Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.  The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.  Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster.Stronger drinks tend to be absorbed faster.  Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your ""blood alcohol level."" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.  Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The legal limit for blood alcohol usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms:  - 0.05 -- reduced inhibitions  - 0.10 -- slurred speech  - 0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment  - 0.30 -- confusion  - 0.40 -- stupor  - 0.50 -- coma  - 0.60 -- respiratory paralysis and death    You can have symptoms of ""being drunk"" at blood alcohol levels below the legal definition of being drunk. Also, people who drink alcohol frequently may not have symptoms until a higher blood alcohol level is reached.  HEALTH RISKS OF ALCOHOL  Alcohol increases the risk of:  - Alcoholism  - Falls, drownings, and other accidents  - Head, neck, stomach, and breast cancers  - Motor vehicle accidents  - Risky sex behaviors, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  - Suicide and homicide    Drinking during pregnancy can harm the developing baby. Severe birth defects or fetal alcohol syndrome are possible.  RESPONSIBLE DRINKING  If you drink alcohol, it is best to do so in moderation. Moderation means the drinking is not getting you intoxicated (or drunk) and you are drinking no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman and no more than 2 if you are a man. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 ounces of liquor.  Here are some ways to drink responsibly, provided you do not have a drinking problem, are of legal age to drink alcohol, and are not pregnant:  - Never drink alcohol and drive a car.  - If you are going to drink, have a designated driver, or plan an alternative way home, such as a taxi or bus.  - Do not drink on an empty stomach. Snack before and while drinking alcohol.    If you are taking medication, including over-the-counter drugs, check with your doctor before drinking alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of many medicines stronger. It can also interact with other medicines, making them ineffective or dangerous or make you sick.  If alcohol use runs in your family, you may be at increased risk of developing this disease yourself. So, you may want to avoid drinking alcohol altogether.  CALL YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IF:  - You are concerned about your personal alcohol use or that of a family member  - You are interested in more information regarding alcohol use or support groups  - You are unable to reduce or stop your alcohol consumption, in spite of attempts to stop drinking    Other resources include:  - Local Alcoholics Anonymous or Al-anon/Alateen groups  - Local hospitals  - Public or private mental health agencies  - School or work counselors  - Student or employee health centers) ",2023,2

What causes Trisomy 13 ? (Also called: Patau syndrome),"Trisomy 13 occurs when extra DNA from chromosome 13 appears in some or all of the body's cells.  - Trisomy 13: the presence of an extra (third) chromosome 13 in all of the cells.  - Trisomy 13: mosaicism, the presence of an extra chromosome 13 in some of the cells.  - Partial trisomy: the presence of a part of an extra chromosome 13 in the cells.   The extra material interferes with normal development.  Trisomy 13 occurs in about 1 out of every 10,000 newborns. Most cases are not passed down through families (inherited). Instead, the events that lead to trisomy 13 occur in either the sperm or the egg that forms the fetus.) ",2044,7

Is trisomy 13 inherited ? (Also called: Bartholin-Patau syndrome; complete trisomy 13 syndrome; Patau syndrome; Patau's syndrome; trisomy 13 syndrome),"Most cases of trisomy 13 are not inherited and result from random events during the formation of eggs and sperm in healthy parents. An error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes. For example, an egg or sperm cell may gain an extra copy of chromosome 13. If one of these atypical reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have an extra chromosome 13 in each cell of the body.  Translocation trisomy 13 can be inherited. An unaffected person can carry a rearrangement of genetic material between chromosome 13 and another chromosome. These rearrangements are called balanced translocations because there is no extra material from chromosome 13. A person with a balanced translocation involving chromosome 13 has an increased chance of passing extra material from chromosome 13 to their children.) ",2046,7

What is (are) Alcohol use and safe drinking ? (Also called: Beer consumption; Wine consumption; Hard liquor consumption; Safe drinking),"Alcohol is one of the most widely used drug substances in the world.  TEEN DRINKING  Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month. This is in spite of the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the U.S.  About 1 in 5 teens are considered ""problem drinkers."" This means that they:  - Get drunk  - Have accidents related to alcohol use  - Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol    THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL  Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them:  - Beer is about 5% alcohol, although some beers can have more.  - Wine is usually 12 to 15% alcohol.  - Hard liquor is about 45% alcohol.    Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.  The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.  Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster.Stronger drinks tend to be absorbed faster.  Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your ""blood alcohol level."" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.  Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The legal limit for blood alcohol usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms:  - 0.05 -- reduced inhibitions  - 0.10 -- slurred speech  - 0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment  - 0.30 -- confusion  - 0.40 -- stupor  - 0.50 -- coma  - 0.60 -- respiratory paralysis and death    You can have symptoms of ""being drunk"" at blood alcohol levels below the legal definition of being drunk. Also, people who drink alcohol frequently may not have symptoms until a higher blood alcohol level is reached.  HEALTH RISKS OF ALCOHOL  Alcohol increases the risk of:  - Alcoholism  - Falls, drownings, and other accidents  - Head, neck, stomach, and breast cancers  - Motor vehicle accidents  - Risky sex behaviors, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  - Suicide and homicide    Drinking during pregnancy can harm the developing baby. Severe birth defects or fetal alcohol syndrome are possible.  RESPONSIBLE DRINKING  If you drink alcohol, it is best to do so in moderation. Moderation means the drinking is not getting you intoxicated (or drunk) and you are drinking no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman and no more than 2 if you are a man. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 ounces of liquor.  Here are some ways to drink responsibly, provided you do not have a drinking problem, are of legal age to drink alcohol, and are not pregnant:  - Never drink alcohol and drive a car.  - If you are going to drink, have a designated driver, or plan an alternative way home, such as a taxi or bus.  - Do not drink on an empty stomach. Snack before and while drinking alcohol.    If you are taking medication, including over-the-counter drugs, check with your doctor before drinking alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of many medicines stronger. It can also interact with other medicines, making them ineffective or dangerous or make you sick.  If alcohol use runs in your family, you may be at increased risk of developing this disease yourself. So, you may want to avoid drinking alcohol altogether.  CALL YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IF:  - You are concerned about your personal alcohol use or that of a family member  - You are interested in more information regarding alcohol use or support groups  - You are unable to reduce or stop your alcohol consumption, in spite of attempts to stop drinking    Other resources include:  - Local Alcoholics Anonymous or Al-anon/Alateen groups  - Local hospitals  - Public or private mental health agencies  - School or work counselors  - Student or employee health centers) ",2105,2

It is often used in combination with other ingredients, including manganese ascorbate, glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, or N-acetyl glucosamine.      Chondroitin sulfate is also taken by mouth for HIV/AIDS, heart disease, heart attack, weak bones (osteoporosis), joint pain caused by drugs used to treat breast cancer, acid reflux, high cholesterol, muscle soreness after exercise, a bladder condition called interstitial cystitis, a bone disease called Kashin-Beck disease, and itchy and scaly skin (psoriasis). Chondroitin sulfate is also used in a complex with iron for treating iron-deficiency anemia.     Chondroitin sulfate is available as an eye drop for dry eyes. In addition, it is used during cataract surgery, and as a solution for preserving corneas used for transplants. It is approved by the FDA for these uses.     Some people with osteoarthritis use ointments or skin creams for pain that contain chondroitin sulfate, in combination with glucosamine sulfate, shark cartilage, and camphor.

What is Glucosamine hydrochloride ?,"Glucosamine is an amino sugar that is produced naturally in humans. It is also found in seashells, or it can be made in the laboratory. Glucosamine hydrochloride is one of several forms of glucosamine.     It is important to read the labels of glucosamine products carefully since several different forms of glucosamine are sold as supplements. These products may contain glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, or N-acetyl-glucosamine. These different chemicals have some similarities. But they may not have the same effects when taken as a dietary supplement. Most of the scientific research on glucosamine has been done using glucosamine sulfate. See the separate listing for glucosamine sulfate. The information on this page is about glucosamine hydrochloride.     Dietary supplements that contain glucosamine often contain additional ingredients. These additional ingredients are frequently chondroitin sulfate, MSM, or shark cartilage. Some people think these combinations work better than taking just glucosamine alone. So far, researchers have found no proof that combining the additional ingredients with glucosamine adds any benefit.     Products that contain glucosamine and glucosamine plus chondroitin vary a great deal. Some do not contain what the label claims. The difference can range from 25% to 115%. Some products in the US that are labeled glucosamine sulfate are actually glucosamine hydrochloride with added sulfate. This product will likely have different effects than one containing glucosamine sulfate.     People take glucosamine hydrochloride by mouth for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, glaucoma, a jaw disorder called temporomandibular disorder (TMD), joint pain, back pain, and weight loss.     Glucosamine hydrochloride is applied to the skin in combination with chondroitin sulfate, shark cartilage, and camphor for osteoarthritis.

In some cases, the amount of glucosamine actually in the product has varied from none to over 100% of the amount stated on the product's label. Some products have contained glucosamine hydrochloride when glucosamine sulfate was listed on the label.     Glucosamine sulfate is taken by mouth for osteoarthritis, glaucoma, weight loss, joint pain caused by drugs, a bladder condition called interstitial cystitis, jaw pain, joint pain including knee pain, back pain, multiple sclerosis, and HIV/AIDS.     Glucosamine is also in some skin creams used to control arthritis pain. These creams usually contain camphor and other ingredients in addition to glucosamine.     Glucosamine sulfate is used parenterally for osteoarthritis.) ",2119,2
What is the action of Glucosamine sulfate and how does it work ?,"Glucosamine sulfate is a chemical found in the human body. It is used by the body to produce a variety of other chemicals that are involved in building tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and the thick fluid that surrounds joints.     Joints are cushioned by the fluid and cartilage that surround them. In some people with osteoarthritis, the cartilage breaks down and becomes thin. This results in more joint friction, pain, and stiffness. Researchers think that taking glucosamine supplements may either increase the cartilage and fluid surrounding joints or help prevent breakdown of these substances, or maybe both.     Some researchers think the ""sulfate"" part of glucosamine sulfate is also important. Sulfate is needed by the body to produce cartilage. This is one reason why researchers believe that glucosamine sulfate might work better than other forms of glucosamine such as glucosamine hydrochloride or N-acetyl glucosamine. These other forms do not contain sulfate.) ",2120,2
What is the dosage of Glucosamine sulfate ?,"The following doses have been studied in scientific research:      BY MOUTH:     - For osteoarthritis: 1500 mg once daily or 500 mg three times daily, either alone or together with 400 mg of chondroitin sulfate two or three times daily, has been used for up to 3 years.

PREVENTING MALARIA  Malaria is a serious disease that spreads by the bite of certain mosquitoes. It occurs mainly in tropical and subtropical climates. Malaria can cause high fevers, shaking chills, flu-like symptoms, and anemia.  If you are traveling to an area where malaria is common, you may need to take medicines that prevent the disease. These medicines are taken before you leave, during your travel, and for a short period after you return. How well the medicines work vary. You should also take steps to prevent insect bites.  PREVENTING INSECT BITES  To prevent against bites from mosquitoes and other insects:  - Wear insect repellent containing DEET or picaridin when you are outdoors, but use it safely.  - You may also need to use a bed mosquito net while you sleep.  - Wear trousers and long-sleeved shirts, particularly at dusk.  - Sleep only in screened areas.  - Do not wear perfumes.    FOOD AND WATER SAFETY  You can get some types of infections by eating or drinking contaminated food or water. There is a high risk of infection from eating undercooked or raw foods.  Stay away from the following foods:  - Cooked food that has been allowed to cool (such as from street vendors)  - Fruit that has not been washed with clean water and then peeled  - Raw vegetables  - Salads  - Unpasteurized dairy foods, such as milk or cheese    Drinking untreated or contaminated water can lead to infection. Only drink the following liquids:  - Canned or unopened bottled beverages (water, juice, carbonated mineral water, soft drinks)  - Drinks made with boiled water, such as tea and coffee    Do not use ice in your drinks unless it is made from purified water. You can purify water by boiling it or by treating it with certain chemical kits or water filters.  OTHER STEPS TO PREVENT INFECTIOUS DISEASES  Clean your hands often. Use soap and water or an alcohol-based cleanser to help prevent infection.  Do not stand or swim in fresh-water rivers, streams, or lakes that have sewage or animal feces in them. This can lead to infection. Swimming in chlorinated pools is safe most of the time.  WHEN TO CONTACT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL  Diarrhea can sometimes be treated with rest and fluids. Your health care provider may give you an antibiotic to take on your trip in case you get sick with severe diarrhea while traveling.  Get medical care right away if:  - Diarrhea does not go away  - You develop a high fever or become dehydrated    Contact your health care provider when you return home if you were sick with a fever while traveling.)

What causes Low blood sugar - newborns ? (Also called: Neonatal hypoglycemia),"Babies need blood sugar (glucose) for energy. Most of that glucose is used by the brain.  The baby gets glucose from the mother through the placenta before birth. After birth, the baby gets glucose from the mother through her milk or from formula, and the baby also produces it in the liver.  Glucose level can drop if:  - There is too much insulin in the blood (hyperinsulinism). Insulin is a hormone that pulls glucose from the blood.  - The baby is not producing enough glucose.  - The baby's body is using more glucose than is being produced.  - The baby is not able to feed enough to keep glucose level up.   Neonatal hypoglycemia occurs when the newborn's glucose level is below the level considered safe for the baby's age. It occurs in about 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 births.  Low blood sugar level ismore likely in infants with one or more of these risk factors:  - Born early, have a serious infection, or needed oxygen right after delivery  - Mother has diabetes (these infants are often larger than normal)  - Have slower than usual growth in the womb during pregnancy  - Are smaller in size than normal for their gestational age) ",2141,5

It's more common in older adults. About half of Americans over age 60 have this condition. Most people will have it by age 80.  No one knows exactly what causes these pouches to form.   For many years, it was thought that eating a low-fiber diet may play a role. Not eating enough fiber can cause constipation (hard stools). Straining to pass stools (feces) increases the pressure in the colon or intestines. This may cause the pouches to form at weak spots in the colon wall. However, whether a low fiber diet leads to this problem is not well proven.  Other possible risk factors that are also not well proven are lack of exercise and obesity.

What is (are) Vitamin C and colds ? (Also called: Colds and vitamin C),"Despite the popular belief that vitamin C can cure the common cold, researchabout this claim is conflicting.  Large doses of vitamin C may help reduce how long a cold lasts, but they do not appear to protect against gettinga cold. This is true even after being exposed to the virus that causes colds.  Taking a vitamin C supplement may help treat a cold only if your bodycurrently has low levels of this vitamin. For example, people who live in cold climates may have low levels of vitamin C, sotaking a vitamin Csupplement may help keep this group of peoplefrom getting colds.This is also truefor people who routinely do vigorous exercise, such as running marathons.  The likelihood of success may vary from person to person. Some people improve, while others do not. People with kidney disease should not take vitamin C supplements.   Taking more than 500 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C at any one time is not helpful. More than that amount is simply lost by our body not absorbing it all or through urination.  Most experts advise that you should eat a balanced diet toget your daily vitamin and mineral requirements.) ",2181,3

What causes Type 2 diabetes ? (Also called: Noninsulin-dependent diabetes; Diabetes - type 2; Adult-onset diabetes),"Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells, called beta cells. The pancreas is below and behind the stomach. Insulin is needed to move blood sugar (glucose) into cells. Inside the cells, glucose is stored and later used for energy.   When you have type 2 diabetes, your fat, liver, and muscle cells do not respond correctly to insulin. This is called insulin resistance. As a result, blood sugar does not get into these cells to be stored for energy.  When sugar cannot enter cells, a high level of sugar builds up in the blood. This is called hyperglycemia. The body is unable to use the glucose for energy. This leads to the symptoms of type 2 diabetes.  Type 2 diabetes usually develops slowly over time. Most people with the disease are overweight or obese when they are diagnosed. Increased fat makes it harder for your body to use insulin the correct way.  Type 2 diabetes can also develop in people who are thin. This is more common in older adults.  Family history and genes play a role in type 2 diabetes. Low activity level, poor diet, and excess body weight around the waist increase your chance of getting the disease.) ",2190,5

This can lead to a heart attack, stroke, and other problems. It can become harder for blood to flow to your legs and feet.  - Nerves in your body can get damaged, causing pain, tingling, and numbness.  - Because of nerve damage, you could have problems digesting the food you eat. You could feel weakness or have trouble going to the bathroom. Nerve damage can make it harder for men to have an erection.  - High blood sugar and other problems can lead to kidney damage.

"What is (are) age-related macular degeneration ? (Also called: age-related maculopathy; AMD; ARMD; macular degeneration, age-related)","Age-related macular degeneration is an eye disease that is a leading cause of vision loss in older people in developed countries. The vision loss usually becomes noticeable in a person's sixties or seventies and tends to worsen over time.  Age-related macular degeneration mainly affects central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. The vision loss in this condition results from a gradual deterioration of light-sensing cells in the tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color (the retina). Specifically, age-related macular degeneration affects a small area near the center of the retina, called the macula, which is responsible for central vision. Side (peripheral) vision and night vision are generally not affected.  Researchers have described two major types of age-related macular degeneration, known as the dry form and the wet form. The dry form is much more common, accounting for 85 to 90 percent of all cases of age-related macular degeneration. It is characterized by a buildup of yellowish deposits called drusen beneath the retina and slowly progressive vision loss. The condition typically affects vision in both eyes, although vision loss often occurs in one eye before the other.  The wet form of age-related macular degeneration is associated with severe vision loss that can worsen rapidly. This form of the condition is characterized by the growth of abnormal, fragile blood vessels underneath the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid, which damages the macula and makes central vision appear blurry and distorted.) ",2210,10

Before vaccines they were very common, especially among children.  Measles  - Measles virus causes rash, cough, runny nose, eye irritation, and fever.  - It can lead to ear infection, pneumonia, seizures (jerking and staring), brain damage, and death.    Mumps  - Mumps virus causes fever, headache, muscle pain, loss of appetite, and swollen glands.  - It can lead to deafness, meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord covering), painful swelling of the testicles or ovaries, and rarely sterility.    Rubella (German Measles)  - Rubella virus causes rash, arthritis (mostly in women), and mild fever.  - If a woman gets rubella while she is pregnant, she could have a miscarriage or her baby could be born with serious birth defects.    These diseases spread from person to person through the air. You can easily catch them by being around someone who is already infected.  Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine can protect children (and adults) from all three of these diseases.  Thanks to successful vaccination programs these diseases are much less common in the U.S. than they used to be. But if we stopped vaccinating they would return. Who should get MMR vaccine and when?  Children should get 2 doses of MMR vaccine:  - First Dose: 12 to 15 months of age  - Second Dose: 4 to 6 years of age (may be given earlier, if at least 28 days after the 1st dose)    Some infants younger than 12 months should get a dose of MMR if they are traveling out of the country. (This dose will not count toward their routine series.)  Some adults should also get MMR vaccine: Generally, anyone 18 years of age or older who was born after 1956 should get at least one dose of MMR vaccine, unless they can show that they have either been vaccinated or had all three diseases.  MMR vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines.  Children between 1 and 12 years of age can get a ""combination"" vaccine called MMRV, which contains both MMR and varicella (chickenpox) vaccines. There is a separate Vaccine Information Statement for MMRV. Some people should not get MMR vaccine or should wait.  - Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of MMR vaccine, should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies.  - Anyone who had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of MMR or MMRV vaccine should not get another dose.  - Some people who are sick at the time the shot is scheduled may be advised to wait until they recover before getting MMR vaccine.  - Pregnant women should not get MMR vaccine. Pregnant women who need the vaccine should wait until after giving birth. Women should avoid getting pregnant for 4 weeks after vaccination with MMR vaccine.  - Tell your doctor if the person getting the vaccine:        - Has HIV/AIDS, or another disease that affects the immune system    - Is being treated with drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids    - Has any kind of cancer    - Is being treated for cancer with radiation or drugs    - Has ever had a low platelet count (a blood disorder)    - Has gotten another vaccine within the past 4 weeks    - Has recently had a transfusion or received other blood products    - Any of these might be a reason to not get the vaccine, or delay vaccination until later.      What are the risks from MMR vaccine?  A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions.  The risk of MMR vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small.  Getting MMR vaccine is much safer than getting measles, mumps or rubella.  Most people who get MMR vaccine do not have any serious problems with it.  Mild problems  - Fever (up to 1 person out of 6)  - Mild rash (about 1 person out of 20)  - Swelling of glands in the cheeks or neck (about 1 person out of 75)    If these problems occur, it is usually within 6-14 days after the shot. They occur less often after the second dose.  Moderate problems  - Seizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (about 1 out of 3,000 doses)  - Temporary pain and stiffness in the joints, mostly in teenage or adult women (up to 1 out of 4)  - Temporary low platelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder (about 1 out of 30,000 doses)    Severe problems (very rare)   - Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses)  - Several other severe problems have been reported after a child gets MMR vaccine, including:        - Deafness    - Long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness    - Permanent brain damage       These are so rare that it is hard to tell whether they are caused by the vaccine. What if there is a serious reaction?  What should I look for?  - Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes.    Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.   What should I do?  - If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.  - Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the VAERS website or by calling 1-800-822-7967.    VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice.

"What is (are) MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella,and varicella) vaccine - what you need to know ?","Measles, Mumps, Rubella & Varicella  Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella (chickenpox) can be serious diseases:  Measles  - Causes rash, cough, runny nose, eye irritation, fever.  - Can lead to ear infection, pneumonia, seizures, brain damage, and death.    Mumps  - Causes fever, headache, swollen glands.  - Can lead to deafness, meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord covering), infection of the pancreas, painful swelling of the testicles or ovaries, and, rarely, death.    Rubella (German Measles)  - Causes rash and mild fever; and can cause arthritis, (mostly in women).  - If a woman gets rubella while she is pregnant, she could have a miscarriage or her baby could be born with serious birth defects.    Varicella (Chickenpox)  - Causes rash, itching, fever, tiredness.  - Can lead to severe skin infection, scars, pneumonia, brain damage, or death.  - Can re-emerge years later as a painful rash called shingles.    These diseases can spread from person to person through the air. Varicella can also be spread through contact with fluid from chickenpox blisters.  Before vaccines, these diseases were very common in the United States. MMRV Vaccine  MMRV vaccine may be given to children from 1 through 12 years of age to protect them from these four diseases.  Two doses of MMRV vaccine are recommended:  - The first dose at 12 through 15 months of age  - The second dose at 4 through 6 years of age    These are recommended ages. But children can get the second dose up through 12 years as long as it is at least 3 months after the first dose.  Children may also get these vaccines as 2 separate shots: MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) and varicella vaccines.  1 Shot (MMRV) or 2 Shots (MMR & Varicella)?  - Both options give the same protection.  - One less shot with MMRV.  - Children who got the first dose as MMRV have had more fevers and fever-related seizures (about 1 in 1,250) than children who got the first dose as separate shots of MMR and varicella vaccines on the same day (about 1 in 2,500).    Your doctor can give you more information, including the Vaccine Information Statements for MMR and Varicella vaccines.  Anyone 13 or older who needs protection from these diseases should get MMR and varicella vaccines as separate shots.  MMRV may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Some children should not get MMRV vaccine or should wait.  Children should not get MMRV vaccine if they:  - Have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of MMRV vaccine, or to either MMR or varicella vaccine.  - Have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine, including gelatin or the antibiotic neomycin. Tell the doctor if your child has any severe allergies.  - Have HIV/AIDS, or another disease that affects the immune system.  - Are being treated with drugs that affect the immune system, including high doses of oral steroids for 2 weeks or longer.  - Have any kind of cancer  - Are being treated for cancer with radiation or drugs    Check with your doctor if the child:  - Has a history of seizures, or has a parent, brother or sister with a history of seizures.  - Has a parent, brother or sister with a history of immune system problems.  - Has ever had a low platelet count, or another blood disorder.  - Recently had a transfusion or received other blood products.  - Might be pregnant.    Children who are moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover before getting MMRV vaccine. Children who are only mildly ill may usually get the vaccine.  Ask your doctor for more information. What are the risks from MMRV vaccine?  A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of MMRV vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small.  Getting MMRV vaccine is much safer than getting measles, mumps, rubella, or chickenpox.  Most children who get MMRV vaccine do not have any problems with it.  Mild problems  - Fever (about 1 child out of 5).  - Mild rash (about 1 child out of 20).  - Swelling of glands in the cheeks or neck (rare).    If these problems happen, it is usually within 5 to 12 days after the first dose. They happen less often after the second dose.  Moderate problems  - Seizure caused by fever (about 1 child in 1,250 who get MMRV), usually 5 to 12 days after the first dose. They happen less often when MMR and varicella vaccines are given at the same visit as separate shots (about 1 child in 2,500 who get these two vaccines), and rarely after a 2nd dose of MMRV.  - Temporary low platelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder (about 1 child out of 40,000).    Severe problems (very rare)  Several severe problems have been reported following MMR vaccine, and might also happen after MMRV. These include severe allergic reactions (fewer than 4 per million), and problems such as:  - Deafness.  - Long-term seizures, coma, lowered consciousness.  - Permanent brain damage.    Because these problems occur so rarely, we can't be sure whether they are caused by the vaccine or not. What if there is a serious reaction?

"Why get vaccinated with MMR Vaccine (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) ?","Measles, mumps, and rubella are serious diseases. Before vaccines they were very common, especially among children.  - Measles virus causes rash, cough, runny nose, eye irritation, and fever.  - It can lead to ear infection, pneumonia, seizures (jerking and staring), brain damage, and death.   - Mumps virus causes fever, headache, muscle pain, loss of appetite, and swollen glands.  - It can lead to deafness, meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord covering), painful swelling of the testicles or ovaries, and rarely sterility.   - Rubella virus causes rash, arthritis (mostly in women), and mild fever.  - If a woman gets rubella while she is pregnant, she could have a miscarriage or her baby could be born with serious birth defects.   These diseases spread from person to person through the air. You can easily catch them by being around someone who is already infected.  Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine can protect children (and adults) from all three of these diseases.  Thanks to successful vaccination programs these diseases are much less common in the U.S. than they used to be. But if we stopped vaccinating they would return.) ",2216,8
"Who should get MMR Vaccine (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) and why is it prescribed ?","should get 2 doses of MMR vaccine:   - First Dose: 12 to 15 months of age  - Second Dose: 4 to 6 years of age (may be given earlier, if at least 28 days after the 1st dose)   Some infants younger than 12 months should get a dose of MMR if they are traveling out of the country. (This dose will not count toward their routine series.)  Some adults should also get MMR vaccine: Generally, anyone 18 years of age or older who was born after 1956 should get at least one dose of MMR vaccine, unless they can show that they have either been vaccinated or had all three diseases.  MMR vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines.  Children between 1 and 12 years of age can get a combination vaccine called MMRV, which contains both MMR and varicella (chickenpox) vaccines. There is a separate Vaccine Information Statement for MMRV.) ",2217,8

Primary brain tumors may be:  - Not cancerous (benign)  - Invasive (spread to nearby areas)  - Cancerous (malignant)    Brain tumors are classified based on:  - The exact site of the tumor  - The type of tissue involved  - Whether it is cancerous    Brain tumors can directly destroy brain cells. They can also indirectly damage cells by pushing on other parts of the brain. This leads to swelling and increased pressure inside the skull.  Tumors can occur at any age. Many tumors are more common at a certain age. In general, brain tumors in children are very rare.  COMMON TUMOR TYPES  Astrocytomas are usually noncancerous, slow-growing tumors. They commonly develop in children ages 5 to 8. Also called low-grade gliomas, these are the most common brain tumors in children.  Medulloblastomas are the most common type of childhood brain cancer. Most medulloblastomas occur before age 10.  Ependymomas are a type of childhood brain tumor that can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). The location and type of ependymoma determine the type of therapy needed to control the tumor.  Brainstem gliomas are very rare tumors that occur almost only in children. The average age at which they develop is about 6. The tumor may grow very large before causing symptoms.) ",2226,3

Some tumors may be completely removed. In cases where the tumor cannot be removed, surgery may help reduce pressure and relieve symptoms. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be used for certain tumors.  The following are treatments for specific types of tumors:  - Astrocytoma: Surgery to remove the tumor is the main treatment. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy may also be necessary.  - Brainstem gliomas: Surgery is usually not possible because of the tumor's location deep in the brain. Radiation is used to shrink the tumor and prolong life.  - Ependymomas: Treatment includes surgery. Radiation and chemotherapy may be necessary.  - Medulloblastomas: Surgery alone does not cure this type of tumor. Chemotherapy with or without radiation is often used in combination with surgery.    Medicines used to treat primary brain tumors in children include:  - Corticosteroids to reduce brain swelling  - Diuretics (water pills) to reduce brain swelling and pressure  - Anticonvulsants to reduce or prevent seizures  - Pain medicines    Comfort measures, safety measures, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other such steps may be required to improve quality of life.)

Eat foods from each group at every meal.  - Learn more about eating healthy and eating out.  - Choosing healthy snacks and drinks for your children is important.  - Fruits and vegetables are good choices for healthy snacks. They are full of vitamins and low in calories and fat. Some crackers and cheeses also make good snacks.  - Limit junk-food snacks like chips, candy, cake, cookies, and ice cream. The best way to keep kids from eating junk food or other unhealthy snacks is to not have these foods in your house.  - Avoid sodas, sport drinks, and flavored waters, especially ones made with sugar or corn syrup. These drinks are high in calories and can lead to weight gain. If needed, choose beverages with artificial (man-made) sweeteners.    Make sure children have a chance to engage in healthy physical activity every day.  - Experts recommendchildren get 60 minutes of moderate activity every day. Moderate activity means you breathe more deeply than when at rest and your heart beats faster than normal.  - If your child is not athletic, find ways to motivate your child to be more active.  - Encourage children to play, run, bike, and play sports during their free time.  - Children should not watch more than 2 hours oftelevision a day.    WHAT ELSE TO THINK ABOUT  Talk to your health care provider before giving weight loss supplements or herbal remedies to your child. Many claims made by these products are not true. Some supplements can have serious side effects.   Weight loss drugs are not recommended for children.  Bariatric surgery is currently being performed for some children, but only after they've stopped growing.) ",2243,6

Any child under 6 months old or who has other complications should see a specialist right away.  Younger infants will most often need to stay in the hospital and be given antibiotics through a vein. Older infants and children are treated with antibiotics by mouth. If this is not possible, they may need to get treated in the hospital.  Your child should drink plenty of fluids when being treated for a UTI.  Some children may be treated with antibiotics for periods as long as 6 months to 2 years. This treatment is more likely when the child has had repeat infections or vesicoureteral reflux.   After antibiotics are finished, your child's provider may ask you to bring your child back to do another urine test. This may be needed to make sure that bacteria are no longer in the bladder.)

what is cdc doing to address visa and vrsa?,"On this Page General Information about VISA/VRSA What is Staphylococcus aureus? How do VISA and VRSA get their names? What should a patient do if they suspect they have a Staph, MRSA, VISA, or VRSA infection? Are VISA and VRSA infections treatable? How can the spread of VISA and VRSA be prevented? What should a person do if a family member or close friend has VISA or VRSA? What is CDC doing to address VISA and VRSA? Recommendations and Guidelines General Information about VISA/VRSA For more images of this bacterium, search the Public Health Image Library Vancomycin [van?뭟흲?뭢카?뭩in]-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus [staff?뭫?뭠u?뭟aw?뭟us  aw?뭨ee?뭫s] (also called VISA) and Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (also called VRSA) are specific types of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. However, as of October 2010, all VISA and VRSA isolates have been susceptible to other Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Persons who develop this type of staph infection may have underlying health conditions (such as diabetes and kidney disease), tubes going into their bodies (such as catheters), previous infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and recent exposure to vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents. What is Staphylococcus aureus? Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium commonly found on the skin and in the nose of about 30% of individuals. Most of the time, staph does not cause any harm. These infections can look like pimples, boils, or other skin conditions and most are able to be treated. Sometimes staph bacteria can get into the bloodstream and cause serious infections which can be fatal, including: Bacteremia or sepsis when bacteria spread to the bloodstream usually as a result of using catheters or having surgery. Pneumonia which predominantly affects people with underlying lung disease including those on mechanical ventilators. Endocarditis (infection of the heart valves) which can lead to heart failure. Osteomyelitis (bone infection) which can be caused by staph bacteria traveling in the bloodstream or put there by direct contact such as following trauma (puncture wound of foot or intravenous (IV) drug abuse). Top of page How do VISA and VRSA get their names? Staph bacteria are classified as VISA or VRSA based on laboratory tests. Laboratories perform tests to determine if staph bacteria are resistant to antimicrobial agents that might be used for treatment of infections. For vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents, laboratories determine how much of the agent it requires to inhibit the growth of the organism in a test tube. The result of the test is usually expressed as a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or the minimum amount of antimicrobial agent that inhibits bacterial growth in the test tube. Therefore, staph bacteria are classified as VISA if the MIC for vancomycin is 4-8쨉g/ml, and classified as VRSA if the vancomycin MIC is ??6쨉g/ml. Top of page What should a patient do if they suspect they have a staph, MRSA, VISA, or VRSA infection? See a healthcare provider. Top of page Are VISA and VRSA infections treatable? Yes. As of October 2010, all VISA and VRSA isolates have been susceptible to several Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Top of page How can the spread of VISA and VRSA be prevented? Use of appropriate infection control practices (such as wearing gloves before and after contact with infectious body substances and adherence to hand hygiene) by healthcare personnel can reduce the spread of VISA and VRSA. Top of page What should a person do if a family member or close friend has VISA or VRSA? VISA and VRSA are types of antibiotic-resistant staph bacteria. Therefore, as with all staph bacteria, spread occurs among people having close physical contact with infected patients or contaminated material, such as bandages. Persons having close physical contact with infected patients while they are outside of the healthcare setting should: (1) keep their hands clean by washing thoroughly with soap and water, and (2) avoid contact with other people's wounds or material contaminated from wounds. If they go to the hospital to visit a friend or family member who is infected with VISA or VRSA , they must follow the hospital's recommended precautions. Top of page What is CDC doing to address VISA and VRSA? In addition to providing guidance for clinicians and infection control personnel, CDC is also working with state and local health agencies, healthcare facilities, and clinical microbiology laboratories to ensure that laboratories are using proper methods to detect VISA and VRSA. Top of page Recommendations and Guidelines CDC issued a Clinical Reminder, in 2010, which serves as a reminder about the important role of clinical laboratories in the diagnosis of VRSA cases to ensure prompt recognition, isolation, and management by infection control personnel. Investigation and Control of Vancomycin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) [PDF - 300 KB] - This document is a guide to conducting a public health investigation of patients from whom vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA, vancomycin MIC ??16 쨉g/ml) has been isolated.

What causes Iron deficiency anemia ? (Also called: Anemia - iron deficiency),"Iron deficiency anemia is the most common form of anemia.  Red blood cells bring oxygen to the body's tissues. Healthy red blood cells are made in your bone marrow. Red blood cells circulate through your body for 3 to 4 months. Parts of your body, such as your spleen, remove old blood cells.  Iron is a key part of red blood cells. Without iron, the blood cannot carry oxygen effectively. Your body normally gets iron through your diet. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells.  Iron deficiency anemia develops when your body's iron stores run low. This can occur because:  - You lose more blood cells and iron than your body can replace  - Your body does not do a good job of absorbing iron  - Your body is able to absorb iron, but you are not eating enough foods that contain iron  - Your body needs more iron than normal (such as if you are pregnant or breastfeeding)    Bleeding can cause iron loss. Common causes of bleeding are:  - Heavy, long, or frequent menstrual periods  - Cancer in the esophagus, stomach, small bowel, or colon  - Esophageal varices, usually from cirrhosis  - The use of aspirin, ibuprofen, or arthritis medicines for a long time, which can cause gastrointestinal bleeding  - Peptic ulcer disease   The body may not absorb enough iron in your diet due to:  - Celiac disease  - Crohn disease  - Gastric bypass surgery  - Taking too many antacids that contain calcium    You may not get enough iron in your diet if:  - You are a strict vegetarian  - You are an older adult and do not eat a full diet) ",2259,5

What causes Rickets ? (Also called: Osteomalacia in children; Vitamin D deficiency; Renal rickets; Hepatic rickets),"Vitamin D helps the body control calcium and phosphate levels. If the blood levels of these minerals become too low, the body may produce hormones that cause calcium and phosphate to be released from the bones. This leads to weak and soft bones.  Vitamin D is absorbed from food or produced by the skin when exposed to sunlight. Lack of vitamin D production by the skin may occur in people who:  - Live in climates with little exposure to sunlight  - Must stay indoors  - Work indoors during the daylight hours   You may not get enough vitamin D from your diet if you:  - Are lactose intolerant (have trouble digesting milk products)  - Do not drink milk products  - Follow a vegetarian diet   Infants who are breastfed only may develop vitamin D deficiency. Human breast milk does not supply the proper amount of vitamin D. This can be a particular problem for darker-skinned children in winter months (when there are lower levels of sunlight).  Not getting enough calcium and phosphorous in your diet can also lead to rickets. Rickets caused by a lack of these minerals in diet is rare in developed countries, because calcium and phosphorous are found in milk and green vegetables.  Your genes may increase your risk of rickets. Hereditary rickets is a form of the disease that is passed down through families. It occurs when the kidneys are unable to hold onto the mineral phosphate. Rickets may also be caused by kidney disorders that involve renal tubular acidosis.  Disorders that reduce the digestion or absorption of fats will make it more difficult for vitamin D to be absorbed into the body.  Occasionally, rickets may occur in children who have disorders of the liver, or who cannot convert vitamin D to its active form.  Rickets is rare in the United States. It is most likely to occur in children during periods of rapid growth, when the body needs high levels of calcium and phosphate. Rickets may be seen in children ages 6to 24 months. It is uncommon in newborns.) ",2279,7

This may be early in the morning.  - If your child is having minor surgery, your child will go home afterward on the same day.  - If your child is having major surgery, your child will stay in the hospital after the surgery.",2284,4
What is (are) When your child has diarrhea ?,"Diarrhea is the passage of loose or watery stools. For some children, diarrhea is mild and will go away within a few days. For others, it may last longer. It can make your child lose too much fluid (dehydrated) and feel weak.  The stomach flu is a common cause of diarrhea. Medical treatments, such as antibiotics and some cancer treatments can also cause diarrhea.  This article speaks to diarrhea in children over 1 year of age.) ",2285,2
What is (are) Your child and the flu ?,"The flu is a serious illness. The virus is easily spread, and children are very susceptible to the illness. Knowing the facts about the flu, its symptoms, and when to get vaccinated are all important in the fight against its spread.  This article has been put together to help you protect your child over the age of 2 from the flu. This is not a substitute for medical advice from your health care provider. If you think your child may have the flu, call your provider right away.) ",2286,2
What is (are) Your child and the flu ?,"WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS I SHOULD WATCH FOR IN MY CHILD?  The flu is an infection of the nose, throat, and (sometimes) lungs. Your young child with the flu will most often have a fever of 100F (37.8C) or higher and a sore throat or a cough. Other symptoms you may notice:  - Chills, sore muscles, and headache  - Runny nose  - Acting tired and cranky much of the time  - Diarrhea and vomiting    When your child's fever goes down, many of these symptoms should get better.  HOW SHOULD I TREAT MY CHILD'S FEVER?  Do NOT bundle up a child with blankets or extra clothes, even if your child has the chills. This may keep their fever from coming down, or make it higher.  - Try one layer of lightweight clothing, and one lightweight blanket for sleep.  - The room should be comfortable, not too hot or too cool. If the room is hot or stuffy, a fan may help.    Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help lower fever in children. Sometimes, your provider will tell you to use both types of medicine.  - Know how much your child weighs, and then always check the instructions on the package.  - Give acetaminophen every 4to 6 hours.  - Give ibuprofen every 6to 8 hours. Do NOT use ibuprofen in children younger than 6 months old.  - Never give aspirin to children unless your child's provider tells you to use it.    A fever does not need to come all the way down to normal. Most children will feel better when the temperature drops by even 1 degree.   - A lukewarm bath or sponge bath may help cool a fever. It works better if the child also is given medicine -- otherwise the temperature might bounce right back up.  - Do NOT use cold baths, ice, or alcohol rubs. These often cause shivering and make things worse.    WHAT ABOUT FEEDING MY CHILD WHEN HE OR SHE IS SICK?  Your child can eat foods while having a fever, but do not force the child to eat. Encourage your child to drink fluids to prevent dehydration.  Children with the flu often do better with bland foods. A bland diet is made up of foods that are soft, not very spicy, and low in fiber. You may try:  - Breads, crackers, and pasta made with refined white flour  - Refined hot cereals, such as oatmeal and Cream of Wheat  - Fruit juices that are diluted by mixing half water and half juice. Do not give your child too much fruit or apple juice.  - Frozen fruit popsor gelatin (Jell-O) are good choices, especially if the child is vomiting.    WILL MY CHILD NEED ANTIVIRALS OR OTHER MEDICINES?  Children aged 2 to 4 years without high-risk conditions and with mild illness may not need antiviral treatment. Children 5 years and older will often not be given antivirals unless they have another high-risk condition.  When needed, these medicines work best if started within 48 hours after symptoms begin, if possible.   Either oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza) are used.  - Oseltamivir comes as a capsule or in a liquid.  - Zanamivir is taken by inhaler.    Serious side effects from these medicines are quite rare. Health care providers and parents must balance the risk for rare side effects against the risk that their children can become quite sick and even die from the flu.  Talk to your provider before giving any over-the-counter cold medicines to your child.  WHEN SHOULD MY CHILD SEE A DOCTOR OR VISIT AN EMERGENCY ROOM?  Talk to your child's provider or go to the emergency room if:  - Your child does not act alert or more comfortable when their fever goes down.  - Fever and flu symptoms come back after they had gone away.  - There are no tears when they're crying.    SHOULD MY CHILD GET VACCINATED AGAINST THE FLU?  Even if your child has had a flu-like illness, they should still get the flu vaccine. All children 6 months or older should receive the vaccine. Children under 9 years will need a second flu vaccine around 4 weeks after receiving the vaccine for the first time.  There are two types of flu vaccine. One is given as a shot, and the other is sprayed into your child's nose.  - The flu shot contains killed (inactive) viruses. It is not possible to get the flu from this type of vaccine. The flu shot is approved for people age 6 months and older.  - A nasal spray-type swine flu vaccine uses a live, weakened virus instead of a dead one like the flu shot. It is approved for healthy children over 2 years. It should not be used in children who have repeated wheezing episodes, asthma, or other chronic respiratory diseases.    WHAT ARE THE SIDE EFFECTS OF THE VACCINE?  It is not possible to get the flu from either the injection or shot flu vaccine. However, some people do get a low-grade fever for a day or two after the shot.  Most people have no side effects from the flu shot. Some people have soreness at the injection site or minor aches and low-grade fever for several days.  Normal side effects of the nasal flu vaccine include fever, headache, runny nose, vomiting, and some wheezing. Although these symptoms sound like symptoms of the flu, the side effects do not become a severe or life-threatening flu infection.  WILL THE VACCINE HARM MY CHILD?  A small amount of mercury (called thimerosal) is a common preservative in multidose vaccines. Despite concerns, thimerosal-containing vaccines have NOT been shown to cause autism, ADHD, or any other medical problems.  If you have concerns about mercury, all of the routine vaccines are also available without added thimerosal.  WHAT ELSE CAN I DO TO PROTECT MY CHILD FROM THE FLU?  Everyone who comes in close contact with your child should follow these tips:  - Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue away after using it.  - Wash hands often with soap and water for 15to 20 seconds, especially after you cough or sneeze. You may also use alcohol-based hand cleaners.  - Wear a face mask if you have had flu symptoms, or preferably, stay away from children.    If your child is less than 5 years old and has close contact with someone with flu symptoms, talk with your provider.) ",2287,2
"Is Christianson syndrome inherited ? (Also called: Angelman-like syndrome, X-linked; intellectual deficit, X-linked, South African type)","This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The gene associated with this condition is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.  In X-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one mutated copy of the gene in each cell is called a carrier. She can pass on the altered gene but usually does not experience signs and symptoms of the disorder. Occasionally, however, females who carry an SLC9A6 gene mutation have mild learning disabilities. It is unclear if these disabilities are related to the gene mutation or occur by chance.) ",2288,7

In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent.  As the mutation responsible for HDL2 or HDL4 is passed down from one generation to the next, the length of the repeated DNA segment may increase. A longer repeat segment is often associated with more severe signs and symptoms that appear earlier in life. This phenomenon is known as anticipation.

Is 2q37 deletion syndrome inherited ? (Also called: Albright hereditary osteodystrophy-like syndrome; brachydactyly-mental retardation syndrome),"Most cases of 2q37 deletion syndrome are not inherited. They result from a chromosomal deletion that occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development. Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family.  Rarely, affected individuals inherit a copy of chromosome 2 with a deleted segment from an unaffected parent. In these cases, one of the parents carries a chromosomal rearrangement between chromosome 2 and another chromosome. This rearrangement is called a balanced translocation. No genetic material is gained or lost in a balanced translocation, so these chromosomal changes usually do not cause any health problems. However, translocations can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. Children who inherit an unbalanced translocation can have a chromosomal rearrangement with extra or missing genetic material. Some individuals with 2q37 deletion syndrome inherit an unbalanced translocation that deletes genetic material near the end of the long arm of chromosome 2, which results in birth defects and other health problems characteristic of this disorder.)

Do you have information about Child Development,"As children grow older, they develop in several different ways. Child development includes physical, intellectual, social, and emotional changes.    Children grow and mature at very different rates. It's hard to say what ""normal"" is. There can be big differences in height, weight, and build among healthy children. Diet, exercise and genes are all factors. Some children begin puberty or are close to it before they are teenagers.    Children start to become more independent from their parents. They may rebel. They also look outward - to their friends, who are usually of the same sex. Peer approval becomes very important. Your child may try new behaviors to be part of ""the group."" This can also be the time that parents or teachers recognize learning disabilities or behavioral problems in children. These problems can get worse as time goes on, so it is important to get help early.) ",2296,5

What is (are) Rickets ? (Also called: Rachitis),"Rickets causes soft, weak bones in children. It usually occurs when they do not get enough vitamin D, which helps growing bones absorb the minerals calcium and phosphorous. It can also happen when calcium or phosphorus levels are too low.    Your child might not get enough vitamin D if he or she       - Has dark skin    - Spends too little time outside    - Has on sunscreen all the time when out of doors    - Doesn't eat foods containing vitamin D because of lactose intolerance or a strict vegetarian diet    - Is breastfed without receiving vitamin D supplements    - Can't make or use vitamin D because of a medical disorder such as celiac disease       In addition to dietary rickets, children can get an inherited form of the disease. Symptoms include bone pain or tenderness, impaired growth, and deformities of the bones and teeth. Your child's doctor uses lab and imaging tests to make the diagnosis. Treatment is replacing the calcium, phosphorus, or vitamin D that are lacking in the diet. Rickets is rare in the United States.) ",2301,1
What is (are) hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets ? (Also called: hypophosphatemia; VDRR; vitamin D-resistant rickets),"Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets is a disorder related to low levels of phosphate in the blood (hypophosphatemia). Phosphate is a mineral that is essential for the normal formation of bones and teeth.  In most cases, the signs and symptoms of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets begin in early childhood. The features of the disorder vary widely, even among affected members of the same family. Mildly affected individuals may have hypophosphatemia without other signs and symptoms. More severely affected children experience slow growth and are shorter than their peers. They develop bone abnormalities that can interfere with movement and cause bone pain. The most noticeable of these abnormalities are bowed legs or knock knees (a condition in which the lower legs are positioned at an outward angle). These abnormalities become apparent with weight-bearing activities such as walking. If untreated, they tend to worsen with time.  Other signs and symptoms of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can include premature fusion of the skull bones (craniosynostosis) and dental abnormalities. The disorder may also cause abnormal bone growth where ligaments and tendons attach to joints (enthesopathy). In adults, hypophosphatemia is characterized by a softening of the bones known as osteomalacia.  Researchers have described several forms of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets, which are distinguished by their pattern of inheritance and genetic cause. The most common form of the disorder is known as X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH). It has an X-linked dominant pattern of inheritance. X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive forms of the disorder are much rarer. The different inheritance patterns are described below.  Another rare type of the disorder is known as hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH). In addition to hypophosphatemia, this condition is characterized by the excretion of high levels of calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria).) ",2302,7
How many people are affected by hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets ? (Also called: hypophosphatemia; VDRR; vitamin D-resistant rickets),"X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets is the most common form of rickets that runs in families. It affects about 1 in 20,000 newborns. Each of the other forms of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets has been identified in only a few families.) ",2303,1
What are the genetic changes related to hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets ? (Also called: hypophosphatemia; VDRR; vitamin D-resistant rickets),"Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can result from mutations in several genes. Mutations in the PHEX gene, which are responsible for X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, occur most frequently. Mutations in other genes cause the less common forms of the condition.  Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets is characterized by a phosphate imbalance in the body. Among its many functions, phosphate plays a critical role in the formation and growth of bones in childhood and helps maintain bone strength in adults. Phosphate levels are controlled in large part by the kidneys. The kidneys normally excrete excess phosphate in urine, and they reabsorb this mineral into the bloodstream when more is needed. However, in people with hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets, the kidneys cannot reabsorb phosphate effectively and too much of this mineral is excreted from the body in urine. As a result, not enough phosphate is available in the bloodstream to participate in normal bone development and maintenance.  The genes associated with hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets are involved in maintaining the proper balance of phosphate. Many of these genes, including the PHEX gene, directly or indirectly regulate a protein called fibroblast growth factor 23 (produced from the FGF23 gene). This protein normally inhibits the kidneys' ability to reabsorb phosphate into the bloodstream. Gene mutations increase the production or reduce the breakdown of fibroblast growth factor 23. The resulting overactivity of this protein reduces phosphate reabsorption by the kidneys, leading to hypophosphatemia and the related features of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets.) ",2304,7

This called a co-pay.    Once you get a prescription from your provider, you may buy the medicine in different ways.   LOCAL PHARMACIES   The most common place for filling a prescription is at a local pharmacy. Some pharmacies are located inside of a grocery or large ""chain"" store.   It is best to fill all prescriptions with the same pharmacy. That way, the pharmacy has a record of all the medicines you are taking. This helps prevent drug interactions.   Your health plan may require you to use certain pharmacies. This means they may not pay for your prescription if you do not use one of these pharmacies. To find a pharmacy that takes your health plan:  - Call the phone number on the back of your insurance card.  - Call the pharmacy you want to use to see if they have a contract with your insurance plan.    To help the pharmacist fill the prescription:   - Make sure all of the information is filled in clearly.  - Bring your insurance card the first time you fill the prescription.  - When calling the pharmacy for a refill, make sure to give your name, the prescription number, and the name of the medicine.    MAIL-ORDER PHARMACIES   Some people and insurance companies choose to use mail-order pharmacies.   - The prescription is sent to the mail-order pharmacy or phoned in by the provider.  - Your medicine may cost less when you order it by mail. However, it may take a week or more for the medicine to get to you.  - Mail order is best used for long-term medicines you use for chronic problems.  - Buy short-term medicines and drugs that need to be stored at certain temperatures at a local pharmacy.    INTERNET (ONLINE) PHARMACIES   Internet pharmacies can be used for long-term medicines and medical supplies.   - The website should have clear directions for filling or transferring your prescription.  - Make sure that the website has clearly-stated privacy policies and other procedures.  - AVOID any website that claims a doctor can prescribe the medicine without seeing you.)

Water-based lubricants and vaginal moisturizers work very well. Lubricants will moisten the vaginal opening and lining for several hours. The effects of a vaginal cream can last for up to a day.  Soybeans contain plant-based substances called isoflavones. These substances have an effect of the body that is similar to estrogen, but weaker. Therefore, it would seem that a diet rich in soy foods would improve symptoms of vaginal dryness. There continues to be research in this area, but the ideal sources or dose is still unknown. Soy foods include tofu, soy milk, and whole soybeans (also called edamame).  Many women claim that creams containing wild yam help with vaginal dryness. However, there is no good research that has evaluated these creams. Also, extracts of wild yam have not been found to have estrogen- or progesterone-like activities. Some of the products may have synthetic medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) added. MPA is a derivative of progesterone, and is also used in oral contraceptives. Like all supplements, MPA-containing products should be used with caution.  Black cohosh is an herb that some women use as a dietary supplement to relieve menopausal symptoms. However, it is not known if this herb helps with vaginal dryness.) ",2314,2
What is (are) alternating hemiplegia of childhood ? (Also called: alternating hemiplegia syndrome),"Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is a neurological condition characterized by recurrent episodes of temporary paralysis, often affecting one side of the body (hemiplegia). During some episodes, the paralysis alternates from one side of the body to the other or affects both sides at the same time. These episodes begin in infancy or early childhood, usually before 18 months of age, and the paralysis lasts from minutes to days.  In addition to paralysis, affected individuals can have sudden attacks of uncontrollable muscle activity; these can cause involuntary limb movements (choreoathetosis), muscle tensing (dystonia), movement of the eyes (nystagmus), or shortness of breath (dyspnea). People with alternating hemiplegia of childhood may also experience sudden redness and warmth (flushing) or unusual paleness (pallor) of the skin. These attacks can occur during or separately from episodes of hemiplegia.  The episodes of hemiplegia or uncontrolled movements can be triggered by certain factors, such as stress, extreme tiredness, cold temperatures, or bathing, although the trigger is not always known. A characteristic feature of alternating hemiplegia of childhood is that all symptoms disappear while the affected person is sleeping but can reappear shortly after awakening. The number and length of the episodes initially worsen throughout childhood but then begin to decrease over time. The uncontrollable muscle movements may disappear entirely, but the episodes of hemiplegia occur throughout life.  Alternating hemiplegia of childhood also causes mild to severe cognitive problems. Almost all affected individuals have some level of developmental delay and intellectual disability. Their cognitive functioning typically declines over time.) ",2315,10
How many people are affected by alternating hemiplegia of childhood ? (Also called: alternating hemiplegia syndrome),Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is a rare condition that affects approximately 1 in 1 million people.) ,2316,10
What are the genetic changes related to alternating hemiplegia of childhood ? (Also called: alternating hemiplegia syndrome),"Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is primarily caused by mutations in the ATP1A3 gene. Very rarely, a mutation in the ATP1A2 gene is involved in the condition. These genes provide instructions for making very similar proteins. They function as different forms of one piece, the alpha subunit, of a larger protein complex called Na+/K+ ATPase; the two versions of the complex are found in different parts of the brain. Both versions play a critical role in the normal function of nerve cells (neurons). Na+/K+ ATPase transports charged atoms (ions) into and out of neurons, which is an essential part of the signaling process that controls muscle movement.  Mutations in the ATP1A3 or ATP1A2 gene reduce the activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase, impairing its ability to transport ions normally. It is unclear how a malfunctioning Na+/K+ ATPase causes the episodes of paralysis or uncontrollable movements characteristic of alternating hemiplegia of childhood.) ",2317,5
Is alternating hemiplegia of childhood inherited ? (Also called: alternating hemiplegia syndrome),"Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is considered an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases of alternating hemiplegia of childhood result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. However, the condition can also run in families. For unknown reasons, the signs and symptoms are typically milder when the condition is found in multiple family members than when a single individual is affected.) ",2318,7

What are the treatments for Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?,"The first step in a substance treatment program is often detoxification (detox), the process of allowing the body to get rid of the substance. Detoxification under medical supervision allows the symptoms of withdrawal to be treated, but is not addiction treatment in and of itself. (Withdrawal is the sick, sometimes unbearable feeling that people have when trying to stop or cut down on a substance they have become addicted to or have been taking for a long time.)The type of withdrawal symptoms and how long they last vary with the substance abused. For example, withdrawal from certain stimulants may lead to fatigue, depression, and sleep problems. Unsupervised withdrawal from barbiturates and benzodiazepines can be dangerous.) ",2325,1
What are the treatments for Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?,"Different types of medications may be useful at different stages of treatment to help a person stop abusing a substance, stay in treatment, focus on learning new behavioral skills, and avoid relapse. Currently, medications are available to treat addiction to opiates, nicotine, and alcohol, but none are yet approved for treating addiction to stimulants, marijuana, or depressants. Medications for substance abuse treatment help the brain adjust to the absence of the abused substance. These medications act slowly to stave off drug cravings and prevent relapse. For example, buprenorphine, marketed as Subutex or Suboxone, is prescribed by approved physicians to treat people who are addicted to opiate drugs, such as painkillers or heroin. Buprenorphine is useful in the short-term detoxification process by helping ease withdrawal symptoms and in the long-term by staving off cravings and helping prevent relapse.

What causes Benign positional vertigo ? (Also called: Vertigo - positional; Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; BPPV: dizziness- positional),"Benign positional vertigo is also called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). It is caused by a problem in the inner ear.   The inner ear has fluid-filled tubes called semicircular canals. When you move, the fluid moves inside these tubes. The canals are very sensitive to any movement of the fluid. The sensation of the fluid moving in the tube tells your brain the position of your body. This helps you keep your balance.  BPPV occurs when a small piece of bone-like calcium breaks free and floats inside the tube. This sends confusing messages to your brain about your body's position.  BPPV has no major risk factors. But, your risk for developing BPPV may increase if you have:  - Family members with BPPV  - Had a prior head injury (even a slight bump to the head)  - Had an inner ear infection called labyrinthitis) ",2343,2

Beriberi is rare in the United States because most foods are now vitamin enriched. If you eat a normal, healthy diet, you should get enough thiamine. Today, beriberi occurs mostly in patients who abuse alcohol. Drinking heavily can lead to poor nutrition. Excess alcohol makes it harder for the body to absorb and store thiamine.  A rare condition known as genetic beriberi is inherited (passed down through families). People with genetic beriberi lose the ability to absorb thiamine from foods. This can happen slowly over time and symptoms occur when the person is an adult. However, becausehealth care providersmay not consider beriberi in nonalcoholics, this diagnosis is often missed.  Beriberi can occur in breastfed infants when the mother's body is lacking in thiamine. The condition can also affect infants who are fed unusual formulas that don't have enough thiamine.

how can botulism be prevented?,"Many cases of botulism are preventable. Foodborne botulism has often been from home-canned foods with low acid content, such as asparagus, green beans, beets and corn and is caused by failure to follow proper canning methods. However, seemingly unlikely or unusual sources are found every decade, with the common problem of improper handling during manufacture, at retail, or by consumers; some examples are chopped garlic in oil, canned cheese sauce, chile peppers, tomatoes, carrot juice, and baked potatoes wrapped in foil. In Alaska, foodborne botulism is caused by fermented fish and other aquatic game foods. Persons who do home canning should follow strict hygienic procedures to reduce contamination of foods, and carefully follow instructions on safe home canning including the use of pressure canners/cookers as recommended through county extension services or from the US Department of Agriculture. Oils infused with garlic or herbs should be refrigerated. Potatoes which have been baked while wrapped in aluminum foil should be kept hot until served or refrigerated. Because the botulinum toxin is destroyed by high temperatures, persons who eat home-canned foods should consider boiling the food for 10 minutes before eating it to ensure safety. Wound botulism can be prevented by promptly seeking medical care for infected wounds and by not using injectable street drugs. Most infant botulism cases cannot be prevented because the bacteria that causes this disease is in soil and dust.  The bacteria can be found inside homes on floors, carpet, and countertops even after cleaning.  Honey can contain the bacteria that causes infant botulism so, children less than 12 months old should not be fed honey. Honey is safe for persons 1 year of age and older.) ",2394,4

What is (are) Shingles ?,"Shingles is a painful rash that develops on one side of the face or body. The rash forms blisters that typically scab over in 7 to 10 days and clear up within 2 to 4 weeks. Most commonly, the rash occurs in a single stripe around either the left or the right side of the body. In other cases, the rash occurs on one side of the face. In rare cases (usually among people with weakened immune systems), the rash may be more widespread and look similar to a chickenpox rash. Shingles is very common. Fifty percent of all Americans will have had shingles by the time they are 80. While shingles occurs in people of all ages, it is most common in 60- to 80-year-olds. In fact, one out of every three people 60 years or older will get shingles. (Watch the video to learn more about shingles. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) What Causes Shingles? Shingles is caused by a reactivation of the chickenpox virus. It is distinctive because it affects only one side of the body. The early signs of shingles usually develop in three stages: severe pain or tingling, possibly itchy rash, and blisters that look like chickenpox. The virus that causes shingles is a herpes virus, (Another name for shingles is herpes zoster.) Once you are infected with this kind of virus, it remains in your body for life. It stays inactive until a period when your immunity is down. Shingles and Pain The most common complication of shingles is pain -- a condition called post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). People with PHN have severe pain in the areas where they had the shingles rash, even after the rash clears up. In most patients, the pain usually clears up in a few weeks or months, but some people can have pain from PHN for years. Persistent pain from shingles is a common symptom in people over 60. In fact, one out of six people older than 60 years who get shingles will have severe pain. As people get older, they are more likely to develop long-term pain as a complication of shingles and the pain is likely to be more severe. Other Complications Shingles may also lead to other serious complications. - Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected.  -  Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring.  Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected. Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring. - In a very small number of cases, bacteria can cause more serious conditions, including toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis, a severe infection that destroys the soft tissue under the skin.  - The burning waves of pain, loss of sleep, and interference with even basic life activities can cause serious depression.  - In patients with immune deficiency, the rash can be much more extensive than usual and the illness can be complicated by pneumonia. These cases are more serious, but they are rarely fatal.  - Very rarely, shingles can also lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or death.

Shingles Usually Does Not Return People who develop shingles usually have only one episode in their lifetime. However, a person can have a second or even a third episode. The Shingles Vaccine Adults 60 years old or older should talk to their healthcare professional about getting a one-time dose of the shingles vaccine. The vaccine can reduce your risk of shingles and the long-term pain it can cause. If you have already had shingles or you have a chronic medical condition, you can receive the shingles vaccine. (See more about the shingles vaccine in the chapter Prevention.) Is Shingles Contagious? Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered. If You Have Shingles If you have shingles, - keep the rash covered  - avoid touching or scratching the rash  - wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus.  keep the rash covered avoid touching or scratching the rash wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus. Until your rash has developed crusts, avoid contact with - pregnant women who have never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine  - premature or low birth weight infants  - people with weakened immune systems, such as people receiving immunosuppressive medications or undergoing chemotherapy, organ transplant recipients, and people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. pregnant women who have never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine premature or low birth weight infants people with weakened immune systems, such as people receiving immunosuppressive medications or undergoing chemotherapy, organ transplant recipients, and people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

Some people have mostly itching; some feel pain from the gentlest touch or breeze. The most common location for shingles is a band, called a dermatome, spanning one side of the trunk around the waistline. Anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk for shingles. Scientists think that some of the virus particles from the original exposure to the varicella-zoster virus,leave the skin blisters and move into the nervous system. When the varicella-zoster virus reactivates, the virus moves back down the long nerve fibers that extend from the sensory cell bodies to the skin. The viruses multiply, the tell-tale rash erupts, and the person now has shingles.) ",2405,10
What causes Shingles ?,"Shingles is caused by a virus called the varicella-zoster virus -- the one that gave you chickenpox when you were a child. As you recovered from chickenpox, the sores and other symptoms healed, but the virus remained. It is with you for life. Researchers know that the varicella-zoster virus behaves differently from other viruses, such as the flu virus. Our immune system usually kills off invading germs, but it cannot completely knock out this type of virus. The virus just becomes inactive. The virus can become active again, especially in the later years of your life when your immune system doesn't protect you as well from infections. The virus travels from the spinal nerve cells and follows a nerve path out to the skin. Nerve endings in the skin become inflamed and erupt in a very painful rash. Healthcare providers cannot always be sure what the trigger is in each case. They don't know why the virus reactivates in one person with these risk factors, while in another person with the same risk factors, it does not.) ",2406,10
What is (are) Shingles ?,"""A burning, tingly feeling is what I noticed first,"" said an elderly woman describing her symptoms. ""I looked in the mirror, and there was a rash on just one side of my back. Then the shooting pains started. Days later, I could hardly stand to have my clothes touching me. I thought maybe I had hives or poison ivy,"" she said, ""until I went to the doctor."") ",2407,1
What causes Shingles ?,"Caused By A Virus Shingles is caused by a virus called varicella-zoster virus -- the one that gave you chickenpox when you were a child. As you recovered from chickenpox, the sores healed and the other symptoms went away, but the virus remained. It is with you for life. The virus hides out in nerve cells, usually in the spine. But it can become active again. Somehow, the virus gets a signal that your immunity has become weakened. This triggers the reactivation. When the virus becomes active again, it follows a nerve path called a dermatome. The nerve path begins at specific points in the spine, continues around one side of the body, and surfaces at the nerve endings in the skin. The pattern of the rash reflects the location of that nerve path. Risk Factors The leading risk factor for shingles is a history of having had chickenpox. One out of every five people who have had chickenpox is likely to get shingles. Another risk factor is aging. As we age, our natural immunity gradually loses its ability to protect against infection. The shingles virus can take advantage of this and become active again. Conditions that weaken the immune system can also put people at risk for shingles. Shingles is especially dangerous for anyone who has had cancer, radiation treatments for cancer, HIV/AIDS, or a transplant operation. Stress is another factor that may contribute to outbreaks. While stress alone does not cause the outbreaks, shingles often occurs in people who have recently had a stressful event in their lives. Most cases of shingles occur in adults. Only about 5 percent of cases occur in children. With children, immune deficiency is the primary risk factor, but children who had chickenpox before they were one year old may also get shingles before they become adults. There have been studies of adults who had chickenpox as children and were later exposed to children who had chickenpox. Interestingly, that exposure apparently boosted the adult's immunity, which actually helped them avoid getting shingles later in life.) ",2408,10

What is (are) Shingles ?,"Shingles is a painful rash that develops on one side of the face or body. The rash forms blisters that typically scab over in 7 to 10 days and clear up within 2 to 4 weeks. Most commonly, the rash occurs in a single stripe around either the left or the right side of the body. In other cases, the rash occurs on one side of the face. In rare cases (usually among people with weakened immune systems), the rash may be more widespread and look similar to a chickenpox rash. Shingles is very common. Fifty percent of all Americans will have had shingles by the time they are 80. While shingles occurs in people of all ages, it is most common in 60- to 80-year-olds. In fact, one out of every three people 60 years or older will get shingles. (Watch the video to learn more about shingles. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner.

It is distinctive because it affects only one side of the body. The early signs of shingles usually develop in three stages: severe pain or tingling, possibly itchy rash, and blisters that look like chickenpox. The virus that causes shingles is a herpes virus, (Another name for shingles is herpes zoster.) Once you are infected with this kind of virus, it remains in your body for life. It stays inactive until a period when your immunity is down. Shingles and Pain The most common complication of shingles is pain -- a condition called post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). People with PHN have severe pain in the areas where they had the shingles rash, even after the rash clears up. In most patients, the pain usually clears up in a few weeks or months, but some people can have pain from PHN for years. Persistent pain from shingles is a common symptom in people over 60. In fact, one out of six people older than 60 years who get shingles will have severe pain. As people get older, they are more likely to develop long-term pain as a complication of shingles and the pain is likely to be more severe. Other Complications Shingles may also lead to other serious complications. - Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected.  -  Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring.  Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected. Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring. - In a very small number of cases, bacteria can cause more serious conditions, including toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis, a severe infection that destroys the soft tissue under the skin.  - The burning waves of pain, loss of sleep, and interference with even basic life activities can cause serious depression.  - In patients with immune deficiency, the rash can be much more extensive than usual and the illness can be complicated by pneumonia. These cases are more serious, but they are rarely fatal.  - Very rarely, shingles can also lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or death.

Shingles Usually Does Not Return People who develop shingles usually have only one episode in their lifetime. However, a person can have a second or even a third episode. The Shingles Vaccine Adults 60 years old or older should talk to their healthcare professional about getting a one-time dose of the shingles vaccine. The vaccine can reduce your risk of shingles and the long-term pain it can cause. If you have already had shingles or you have a chronic medical condition, you can receive the shingles vaccine. (See more about the shingles vaccine in the chapter Prevention.) Is Shingles Contagious? Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered. If You Have Shingles If you have shingles, - keep the rash covered  - avoid touching or scratching the rash  - wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus.  keep the rash covered avoid touching or scratching the rash wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus.

Even if you have had shingles, you can still get the shingles vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. There is no maximum age for getting the vaccine, and only a single dose is recommended. In a clinical trial involving thousands of adults 60 years old or older, the vaccine reduced the risk of shingles by about half. A One-time Dose To reduce the risk of shingles, adults 60 years old or older should talk to their healthcare professional about getting a one-time dose of the shingles vaccine. Even if the shingles vaccine doesnt prevent you from getting shingles, it can still reduce the chance of having long-term pain. If you have had shingles before, you can still get the shingles vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. There is no maximum age for getting the vaccine. Side Effects Vaccine side effects are usually mild and temporary. In most cases, shingles vaccine causes no serious side effects. Some people experience mild reactions that last up to a few days, such as headache or redness, soreness, swelling, or itching where the shot was given. When To Get the Vaccine The decision on when to get vaccinated should be made with your health care provider. The shingles vaccine is not recommended if you have active shingles or pain that continues after the rash is gone. Although there is no specific time that you must wait after having shingles before receiving the shingles vaccine, you should generally make sure that the shingles rash has disappeared before getting vaccinated. Where To Get the Vaccine The shingles vaccine is available in doctors offices, pharmacies, workplaces, community health clinics, and health departments. Most private health insurance plans cover recommended vaccines. Check with your insurance provider for details and for a list of vaccine providers. Medicare Part D plans cover shingles vaccine, but there may be costs to you depending on your specific plan. If you do not have health insurance, visit www.healthcare.gov  to learn more about health insurance options. Who Should Not Get the Vaccine? You should NOT get the shingles vaccine if you - have an active case of shingles or have pain that continues after the rash is gone  - have ever had a life-threatening or severe allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of the shingles vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies.  - have a weakened immune system because of:  -- HIV/AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system   -- treatment with drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids   -- cancer treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy   -- cancer affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system, such as leukemia or lymphoma.  have an active case of shingles or have pain that continues after the rash is gone have ever had a life-threatening or severe allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of the shingles vaccine.

The shingles vaccine is basically a stronger version of the chickenpox vaccine, which became available in 1995. The chickenpox shot prevents chickenpox in 70 to 90 percent of those vaccinated, and 95 percent of the rest have only mild symptoms. Millions of children and adults have already received the chickenpox shot. Interestingly, the chickenpox vaccine may reduce the shingles problem. Widespread use of the chickenpox vaccine means that fewer people will get chickenpox in the future. And if people do not get chickenpox, they cannot get shingles.

What is (are) Pain medications - narcotics ? (Also called: Painkillers; Drugs for pain; Analgesics; Opioids),"Narcotics are also called opioid pain relievers. They are used only for pain that is severe and is not helped by other types of painkillers. When used carefully and under a health care provider's direct care, these drugs can be effective at reducing pain.  Narcotics work by binding to receptors in the brain, which blocks the feeling of pain.  You should not use a narcotic drug for more than 3 to 4 months, unless you are under direct care of your provider.  NAMES OF NARCOTICS  - Codeine  - Fentanyl -- available as a patch  - Hydrocodone  - Hydromorphone  - Meperidine  - Morphine  - Oxycodone  - Tramadol   TAKING NARCOTICS  These drugs can be abused and habit-forming. They have been associated with accidental overdose deaths. Always take narcotics as prescribed. Your provider may suggest that you take your medicine only when you feel pain.  Or, your doctor may suggest taking a narcotic on a regular schedule. Allowing the medicine to wear off before taking more of it can make the pain difficult to control.   Taking narcotics to control the pain of cancer or other medical problems does not itself lead to dependence.  Store narcotics safely and securely in your home.  You may need a pain specialist to help you manage long-term pain.  SIDE EFFECTS OF NARCOTICS  Drowsiness and impaired judgment often occur with these medicines. When taking a narcotic, do not drink alcohol, drive, or operate heavy machinery.  You can relieve itching by reducing the dose or talking to your doctor about switching medicines.  To help with constipation, drink more fluids, get more exercise, eat foods with extra fiber, and use stool softeners.  If nausea or vomiting occur, try taking the narcotic with food.  Withdrawal symptoms are common when you stop taking a narcotic. Symptoms include strong desire for the medicine (craving), yawning, insomnia, restlessness, mood swings, or diarrhea. To prevent withdrawal symptoms, your doctor may recommend you gradually lower the dosage over time.) ",2418,4

The walls of the arteries also become stiffer and cannot widen (dilate) to allow greater blood flow when needed.   As a result, the muscles of your legs cannot get enough blood and oxygen when they are working harder (such as during exercise or walking). If PAD becomes severe, there may not be enough blood and oxygen, even when the muscles are resting.  Peripheral artery disease is a common disorder.

What is (are) Medications for back pain ?,"Back pain often goes away on its own over several weeks. In some people, back pain persists. It may not go away completely or it may get more painful at times.  Medicines can also help with your back pain.  OVER-THE-COUNTER PAIN RELIEVERS  Over-the-counter means you can buy them without a prescription.  Most health care providers recommend acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) first because it has fewer side effects than other drugs. Do not take more than 3 grams (3,000 mg) on any one day or 24 hours. Overdosing onacetaminophen can cause severe damage to your liver. If you already have liver disease, ask your doctor if acetaminophen isOK for you to take.  If your pain continues, your provider may suggest nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). You can buy some NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, without a prescription.NSAIDs help reduce the swelling around the swollen disc or arthritis in the back.  NSAIDs and acetaminophen in high doses, or if taken for a long time, can cause serious side effects. Side effects include stomach pain,ulcers or bleeding, and liver or kidney damage. If side effectsoccur, stop taking the drug right away and tell your provider.  If you are taking pain relievers for more than a week, tell your provider. You may need to be watched for side effects.   NARCOTIC PAIN RELIEVERS   Narcotics, also called opioid pain relievers, are used only for pain that is severe and is not helped by other types of painkillers. They work well for short-term relief. Do not use them for more than 3to 4 weeksunless instructed by your provider to do so.  Narcotics work by binding to receptors in the brain, which blocks the feeling of pain. These drugs can be abused and are habit-forming. They have been associated with accidental overdose and death. When used carefully and under a provider's direct care, they can be effectivein reducing pain.  Examples of narcotics include:  - Codeine  - Fentanyl -- available as a patch  - Hydrocodone  - Hydromorphone  - Morphine  - Oxycodone  - Tramadol   Possible side effects of these drugs include:  - Drowsiness  - Impaired judgment  - Nausea or vomiting  - Constipation  - Itching   - Slowed breathing   When taking narcotics, do not drink alcohol, drive, or operate heavy machinery.   MUSCLE RELAXANTS   Your provider may prescribe a medicine called a muscle relaxant. Despiteits name,it does not work directly on muscles. Instead,it works through your brain and spinal cord.  This drug isoften given along with over-the-counter pain relievers to relieve the symptoms of back pain or muscle spasm.  Examples of muscle relaxants include:  - Carisoprodol  - Cyclobenzaprine  - Diazepam  - Methocarbamol   Side effectsof muscle relaxants are common and include drowsiness, confusion, nausea, and vomiting.  These medicines can be habit-forming. Talk to your provider before using these drugs. They may interact with other medicines or make certain medical conditions worse.  Do not drive or operate heavy machinery while taking muscle relaxants.Do not drink alcohol while taking these drugs.   ANTIDEPRESSANTS   Antidepressants are normally used to treat people with depression. But, low doses of these medicines can help with chronic low back pain, even if the persondoes not feel sad or depressed.  These drugs work by changing the levels of certain chemicals in your brain. This changes the way your brain notices pain. Antidepressants most commonly used for chronic low back pain also help you sleep.  Antidepressants most often used for back pain are:  - Amitriptyline  - Desipramine  - Duloxetine  - Imipramine  - Nortriptyline   Common side effects include dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, weight gain, sleepiness, problems urinating, and sexual problems. Less commonly, some of these drugs can alsocause heart and lung problems.  Do not take these drugs unless you are under the care of a provider. Do not stop taking these drugs suddenly or change the dose without also talking with yourprovider.   ANTI-SEIZURE OR ANTICONVULSANT MEDICINES   Anticonvulsant medicines are used to treat people with seizures or epilepsy. They work by causing changes in the electric signals in the brain. They work best for pain that is caused by nerve damage.  These drugs may help some people whose long-term back pain has made it hard for them to work, or pain thatinterferes with their daily activities.  Anticonvulsants most often used to treat chronic pain are:  - Carbamazepine  - Gabapentin  - Lamotrigine  - Pregabalin  - Valproic acid   Common side effects include weight gain or weight loss, upset stomach, loss of appetite, skin rashes, drowsiness or feeling confused, and headaches.

There are many different pain medicines, and each one has advantages and risks. Some types of pain respond better to certain medicines than others. Each person may also have a slightly different response to a pain reliever.     Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are good for many types of pain. There are two main types of OTC pain medicines: acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Aspirin, naproxen (Aleve), and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) are examples of OTC NSAIDs.    If OTC medicines don't relieve your pain, your doctor may prescribe something stronger. Many NSAIDs are also available at higher prescription doses. The most powerful pain relievers are narcotics. They are very effective, but they can sometimes have serious side effects.

Do you have information about Alternative medicine - pain relief (Also called: Acupuncture - pain relief; Hypnosis - pain relief; Guided imagery),"Alternative medicine refers to treatments that are used instead of conventional (standard) ones. If you use an alternative treatment along with conventional medicine or therapy, it is considered complementary therapy.  There are many forms of alternative medicine.  Acupuncture involves stimulating certain acupoints on the body using fine needles or other methods. How acupuncture works is not entirely clear. It is thought that acupoints lie near nerve fibers. When acupoints are stimulated, the nerve fibers signal the spinal cord and brain to release chemicals that relieve pain.   Acupuncture is an effective means of relieving pain, such as for back pain and headache pain. Acupuncture may also help relieve pain due to:  - Cancer  - Carpal tunnel syndrome  - Fibromyalgia  - Childbirth (labor)  - Musculoskeletal injuries (such as the neck, shoulder, knee, or elbow)  - Osteoarthritis  - Rheumatoid arthritis   Hypnosis is a focused state of concentration. With self-hypnosis, you repeat a positive statement over and over.  Hypnosis may help relieve pain for:  - After surgery or labor  - Arthritis  - Cancer  - Fibromyalgia  - Irritable bowel syndrome  - Migraine headache  - Tension headache   Both acupuncture and hypnosis are often offered by pain management centers in the United States.

Do you have information about Pain Relievers (Also called: Analgesics; Pain killers; Pain medicines),"Pain relievers are medicines that reduce or relieve headaches, sore muscles, arthritis, or other aches and pains. There are many different pain medicines, and each one has advantages and risks. Some types of pain respond better to certain medicines than others. Each person may also have a slightly different response to a pain reliever.     Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are good for many types of pain. There are two main types of OTC pain medicines: acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Aspirin, naproxen (Aleve), and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) are examples of OTC NSAIDs.    If OTC medicines don't relieve your pain, your doctor may prescribe something stronger. Many NSAIDs are also available at higher prescription doses. The most powerful pain relievers are narcotics. They are very effective, but they can sometimes have serious side effects. Because of the risks, you must use them only under a doctor's supervision.    There are many things you can do to help ease pain. Pain relievers are just one part of a pain treatment plan.) ",2430,8

What causes Diabetes ? (Also called: Diabetes - type 1; Diabetes - type 2; Diabetes - gestational; Type 1 diabetes; Type 2 diabetes; Gestational diabetes; Diabetes mellitus),"Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.  To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested:  - A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.  - An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel.     People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the bloodinto muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and because their liver makestoo much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either:  - Their pancreas does not make enough insulin  - Their cells do not respond to insulin normally  - Both of the above    There are 2 major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type:   - Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown.  - Type 2 diabetes is much more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease.Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should.  - There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2.    Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes.  If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop the disease.) ",2456,5
What is (are) Diabetes ? (Also called: Diabetes mellitus; DM),"Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes. This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes.    Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes.    Blood tests can show if you have diabetes. One type of test, the A1C, can also check on how you are managing your diabetes. Exercise, weight control and sticking to your meal plan can help control your diabetes.

What is (are) Diabetes ?,"Too Much Glucose in the Blood Diabetes means your blood glucose (often called blood sugar) is too high. Your blood always has some glucose in it because your body needs glucose for energy to keep you going. But too much glucose in the blood isn't good for your health. Glucose comes from the food you eat and is also made in your liver and muscles. Your blood carries the glucose to all of the cells in your body. Insulin is a chemical (a hormone) made by the pancreas. The pancreas releases insulin into the blood. Insulin helps the glucose from food get into your cells. If your body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin doesn't work the way it should, glucose can't get into your cells. It stays in your blood instead. Your blood glucose level then gets too high, causing pre-diabetes or diabetes. Types of Diabetes There are three main kinds of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. The result of type 1 and type 2 diabetes is the same: glucose builds up in the blood, while the cells are starved of energy. Over the years, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, oftentimes leading to complications such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease, nerve problems, gum infections, and amputation. Type 1 Diabetes Type 1 diabetes, which used to be called called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, develops most often in young people. However, type 1 diabetes can also develop in adults. With this form of diabetes, your body no longer makes insulin or doesnt make enough insulin because your immune system has attacked and destroyed the insulin-producing cells. About 5 to 10 percent of people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes. To survive, people with type 1 diabetes must have insulin delivered by injection or a pump. Learn more about type 1 diabetes here. Type 2 Diabetes Type 2 diabetes, which used to be called adult-onset diabetes or non insulin-dependent diabetes, is the most common form of diabetes. Although people can develop type 2 diabetes at any age -- even during childhood -- type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people. Type 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistancea condition that occurs when fat, muscle, and liver cells do not use insulin to carry glucose into the bodys cells to use for energy. As a result, the body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells. At first, the pancreas keeps up with the added demand by making more insulin. Over time, the pancreas doesnt make enough insulin when blood sugar levels increase, such as after meals. If your pancreas can no longer make enough insulin, you will need to treat your type 2 diabetes. Learn more about type 2 diabetes here. Gestational Diabetes Some women develop gestational diabetes during the late stages of pregnancy. Gestational diabetes is caused by the hormones of pregnancy or a shortage of insulin. Although this form of diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born, a woman who has had it and her child are more likely to develop diabetes later in life. Prediabetes Prediabetes means your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. People with prediabetes are at an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes and for heart disease and stroke. The good news is that if you have prediabetes, you can reduce your risk of getting type 2 diabetes. With modest weight loss and moderate physical activity, you can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes.  Learn more about prediabetes here.  Signs of Diabetes Many people with diabetes experience one or more symptoms, including extreme thirst or hunger, a frequent need to urinate and/or fatigue. Some lose weight without trying. Additional signs include sores that heal slowly, dry, itchy skin, loss of feeling or tingling in the feet and blurry eyesight. Some people with diabetes, however, have no symptoms at all. How Many Have Diabetes? Nearly 29 million Americans age 20 or older (12.3 percent of all people in this age group) have diabetes, according to 2014 estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). About 1.9 million people aged 20 years or older were newly diagnosed with diabetes in 2010 alone. People can get diabetes at any age, but the risk increases as we get older. In 2014, over 11 million older adults living in the U.S -- nearly 26 percent of people 65 or older -- had diabetes. See more statistics about diabetes from the  National Diabetes Statistics Report 2014. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) If Diabetes is Not Managed Diabetes is a very serious disease. Over time, diabetes that is not well managed causes serious damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, gums and teeth. If you have diabetes, you are more likely than people without diabetes to have heart disease or a stroke. People with diabetes also tend to develop heart disease or stroke at an earlier age than others. The best way to protect yourself from the serious complications of diabetes is to manage your blood glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol and to avoid smoking. It is not always easy, but people who make an ongoing effort to manage their diabetes can greatly improve their overall health.) ",2461,5

The body only gets the calcium it needs through the food you eat, or from supplements. If you do not get enough calcium in your diet, or if your body does not absorb enough calcium, your bones can get weak or will not grow properly.  Bone density refers to how much calcium and other minerals are present in a section of your bone. Bone density is highest between ages 25 and 35. It goes down as you get older. This can result in brittle, fragile bones that can break easily, even without a fall or other injury.  As you age, your body still needs calcium to keep your bones dense and strong. Most experts recommend at least 1,200 milligrams of calcium and 800 to 1,000 international units of vitamin D a day. Your doctor may recommend a supplement to give you the calcium and vitamin D you need.  Some groups recommend much higher doses of vitamin D, but many experts feel that high doses of vitamin D are not safe for everyone. Be sure to discuss with your health care provider whether supplements are a good choice for you.   Follow a diet that provides the proper amount of calcium, vitamin D, and protein. These nutrientswill not completely stop bone loss, but they will help ensure that your body has the materials it needs to build bones.

Older women and men may need extra calcium to prevent their bones from getting thin (osteoporosis).  Your health care provider will tell you if you need to take extra calcium.  TYPES OF CALCIUM SUPPLEMENTS   Forms of calcium include:  - Calcium carbonate: Over-the-counter (OTC) antacid products, such as Tums and Rolaids, contain calcium carbonate. These sources of calcium do not cost much. Each pill or chew provides 200 to 400 mg of calcium.  - Calcium citrate: This is a more expensive form of calcium. It is absorbed well on an empty or full stomach. People with low levels of stomach acid (a condition that is more common in people over age 50) absorb calcium citrate better than calcium carbonate.  - Other forms, such as calcium gluconate, calcium lactate, calcium phosphate: Most have less calcium than the carbonate and citrate forms.    When choosing a calcium supplement:  - Look the word ""purified"" or the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) symbol on the label.  - Avoid products made from unrefined oyster shell, bone meal, or dolomite that do not have the USP symbol. They may have high levels of lead or other toxic metals.    HOW TO TAKE EXTRA CALCIUM   Increase the dose of your calcium supplement slowly. Start with 500 mg a day for a week, and then add more over time.  Try to spread the extra calcium you take over the day. DO NOT take more than 500 mg at a time. Taking calcium throughout the day will:  - Allow more calcium to be absorbed  - Cut down on side effects such as gas, bloating, and constipation    The total amount of calcium adults need every day from food and calcium supplements:  - 19 to 50 years: 1,000 mg/day  - 51 to 70 years: Men - 1,000 mg/day; Women - 1,200 mg/day  - 71 years and over: 1,200 mg/day    The body needs vitamin D to help absorb calcium. You can get vitamin D from sunlight exposure to your skin and from your diet. Ask your provider whether you need to take a vitamin D supplement.  SIDE EFFECTS AND SAFETY  DO NOT take more than the recommended amount of calcium without your provider's ok.  Try the following steps if you have side effects from taking extra calcium:   - Drink more fluids.  - Eat high-fiber foods  - Switch to another form of calcium if the diet changes do not help.    Always tell your provider and pharmacist if you are taking extra calcium. Calcium supplements may change the way your body absorbs some medicines. These include certain types of antibiotics and iron pills.  Be aware of the following:  - Taking extra calcium over a long period of time raises the risk of kidney stones in some people.  - Too much calcium can prevent the body from absorbing iron, zinc, magnesium, and phosphorus.  - Antacids have other ingredients such as sodium, aluminum, and sugar. Ask your provider if antacids are ok for you use as a calcium supplement.) ",2518,7
Do you have information about Laboratory Tests,"Laboratory tests check a sample of your blood, urine, or body tissues. A technician or your doctor analyzes the test samples to see if your results fall within the normal range. The tests use a range because what is normal differs from person to person. Many factors affect test results. These include       -  Your sex, age and race    -  What you eat and drink    -  Medicines you take    -  How well you followed pre-test instructions       Your doctor may also compare your results to results from previous tests. Laboratory tests are often part of a routine checkup to look for changes in your health. They also help doctors diagnose medical conditions, plan or evaluate treatments, and monitor diseases.)

What is (are) Osteogenesis imperfecta ? (Also called: Brittle bone disease; Congenital disease; OI),Osteogenesis imperfecta is a condition causing extremely fragile bones.) ,2520,1
What causes Osteogenesis imperfecta ? (Also called: Brittle bone disease; Congenital disease; OI),"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is present at birth. It is often caused by a defect in the gene that produces type 1 collagen, an important building block of bone. There are many defects that can affect this gene. The severity of OI depends on the specific gene defect.  If you have 1 copy of the gene, you will have the disease. Most cases of OI are inherited from a parent. However, some cases are the result of new genetic mutations.  A person with OI has a 50% chance of passing on the gene and the disease to his or her children.) ",2521,7
What are the symptoms of Osteogenesis imperfecta ? (Also called: Brittle bone disease; Congenital disease; OI),"All people with OI have weak bones, and fractures are more likely. People with OI are most often below average height (short stature). However, the severity of the disease varies greatly.  The classic symptoms include:  - Blue tint to the whites of their eyes (blue sclera)  - Multiple bone fractures  - Early hearing loss (deafness)   Because type I collagen is also found in ligaments, people with OI often have loose joints (hypermobility) and flat feet. Some types of OI also lead to the development of poor teeth.  Symptoms of more severe forms of OI may include:  - Bowed legs and arms  - Kyphosis  - Scoliosis (S-curve spine)) ",2522,1
What are the treatments for Osteogenesis imperfecta ? (Also called: Brittle bone disease; Congenital disease; OI),"There is not yet a cure for this disease. However, specific therapies can reduce the pain and complications from OI.  Drugs that can increase the strength and density of bone are used in people with OI. They have been shown to reduce bone pain and fracture rate (especially in the bones of the spine). They are called bisphosphonates.  Low impact exercises, such as swimming, keep muscles strong and help maintain strong bones. People with OI can benefit from these exercises and should be encouraged to do them.  In more severe cases, surgery to place metal rods into the long bones of the legs may be considered. This procedure can strengthen the bone and reduce the risk for fracture. Bracing can also be helpful for some people.  Surgery may be needed to correct any deformities. This treatment is important because deformities (such as bowed legs or a spinal problem) can interfere with a person's ability to move or walk.  Even with treatment, fractures will occur. Most fractures heal quickly. Time in a cast should be limited, because bone loss may occur when you do not use a part of your body for a period of time.  Many children with OI develop body image problems as they enter their teenage years. A social worker or psychologist can help them adapt to life with OI.) ",2523,1
What are the complications of Osteogenesis imperfecta ? (Also called: Brittle bone disease; Congenital disease; OI),Complications are largely based on the type of OI present. They are often directly related to the problems with weak bones and multiple fractures.  Complications may include:  - Hearing loss (common in type I and type III)  - Heart failure (type II)  - Respiratory problems and pneumonias due to chest wall deformities  - Spinal cord or brain stem problems  - Permanent deformity) ,2524,0
Do I need to see a doctor for Osteogenesis imperfecta ?

The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Osteogenesis imperfecta type II. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of pelvic girdle bone morphology - Absent ossification of calvaria - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Beaded ribs - Blue sclerae - Broad long bones - Congestive heart failure - Convex nasal ridge - Crumpled long bones - Disproportionate short-limb short stature - Large fontanelles - Multiple prenatal fractures - Nonimmune hydrops fetalis - Platyspondyly - Premature birth - Pulmonary insufficiency - Recurrent fractures - Respiratory insufficiency - Small for gestational age - Thin skin - Tibial bowing - Wormian bones - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.) ",2527,8
"What is (are) gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia ? (Also called: GDD; gnathodiaphyseal sclerosis; Levin syndrome 2; osteogenesis imperfecta with unusual skeletal lesions; osteogenesis imperfecta, Levin type)","Gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia is a disorder that affects the bones. People with this condition have reduced bone mineral density (osteopenia), which causes the bones to be unusually fragile. As a result, affected individuals typically experience multiple bone fractures in childhood, often from mild trauma or with no apparent cause.  While most bone tissue is less dense than normal in gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia, the outer layer (cortex) of the shafts of the long bones in the arms and legs is abnormally hard and thick (diaphyseal sclerosis). Bowing of the long bones also occurs in this disorder.  Jaw problems are common in gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia; the prefix ""gnatho-"" in the condition name refers to the jaw. Affected individuals may develop bone infections (osteomyelitis) in the jaw, which can lead to pain, swelling, discharge of pus from the gums, loose teeth, and slow healing after teeth are lost or extracted. Areas of the jawbone may lose the protective coverage of the gums, which can result in deterioration of the exposed bone (osteonecrosis of the jaw). Also, normal bone in areas of the jaw may be replaced by fibrous tissue and a hard material called cementum, which normally surrounds the roots of teeth and anchors them in the jaw. These areas of abnormal bone, called cementoosseous lesions, may be present at birth or develop later in life.  When gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia was first described, it was thought to be a variation of another bone disorder called osteogenesis imperfecta, which is also characterized by frequent bone fractures. However, gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia is now generally considered to be a separate condition. Unlike in osteogenesis imperfecta, the fractures in gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia heal normally without causing deformity or loss of height.) ",2528,1
What is (are) osteogenesis imperfecta ? (Also called: Brittle bone disease; Fragilitas ossium; OI; Vrolik disease),"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of genetic disorders that mainly affect the bones. The term ""osteogenesis imperfecta"" means imperfect bone formation. People with this condition have bones that break easily, often from mild trauma or with no apparent cause. Multiple fractures are common, and in severe cases, can occur even before birth. Milder cases may involve only a few fractures over a person's lifetime.  There are at least eight recognized forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, designated type I through type VIII. The types can be distinguished by their signs and symptoms, although their characteristic features overlap. Type I is the mildest form of osteogenesis imperfecta and type II is the most severe; other types of this condition have signs and symptoms that fall somewhere between these two extremes. Increasingly, genetic factors are used to define the different forms of osteogenesis imperfecta.  The milder forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, including type I, are characterized by bone fractures during childhood and adolescence that often result from minor trauma. Fractures occur less frequently in adulthood. People with mild forms of the condition typically have a blue or grey tint to the part of the eye that is usually white (the sclera), and may develop hearing loss in adulthood. Affected individuals are usually of normal or near normal height.  Other types of osteogenesis imperfecta are more severe, causing frequent bone fractures that may begin before birth and result from little or no trauma. Additional features of these conditions can include blue sclerae, short stature, hearing loss, respiratory problems, and a disorder of tooth development called dentinogenesis imperfecta. The most severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, particularly type II, can include an abnormally small, fragile rib cage and underdeveloped lungs. Infants with these abnormalities have life-threatening problems with breathing and often die shortly after birth.) ",2529,1
What are the genetic changes related to osteogenesis imperfecta ? (Also called: Brittle bone disease; Fragilitas ossium; OI; Vrolik disease),"Mutations in the COL1A1, COL1A2, CRTAP, and P3H1 genes cause osteogenesis imperfecta.  Mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes are responsible for more than 90 percent of all cases of osteogenesis imperfecta. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are used to assemble type I collagen. This type of collagen is the most abundant protein in bone, skin, and other connective tissues that provide structure and strength to the body.  Most of the mutations that cause osteogenesis imperfecta type I occur in the COL1A1 gene. These genetic changes reduce the amount of type I collagen produced in the body, which causes bones to be brittle and to fracture easily. The mutations responsible for most cases of osteogenesis imperfecta types II, III, and IV occur in either the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene. These mutations typically alter the structure of type I collagen molecules. A defect in the structure of type I collagen weakens connective tissues, particularly bone, resulting in the characteristic features of osteogenesis imperfecta.  Mutations in the CRTAP and P3H1 genes are responsible for rare, often severe cases of osteogenesis imperfecta. Cases caused by CRTAP mutations are usually classified as type VII; when P3H1 mutations underlie the condition, it is classified as type VIII. The proteins produced from these genes work together to process collagen into its mature form. Mutations in either gene disrupt the normal folding, assembly, and secretion of collagen molecules. These defects weaken connective tissues, leading to severe bone abnormalities and problems with growth.  In cases of osteogenesis imperfecta without identified mutations in one of the genes described above, the cause of the disorder is unknown. These cases include osteogenesis imperfecta types V and VI. Researchers are working to identify additional genes that may be responsible for these conditions.) ",2530,7
Is osteogenesis imperfecta inherited ? (Also called: Brittle bone disease; Fragilitas ossium; OI; Vrolik disease),"Most cases of osteogenesis imperfecta have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. Many people with type I or type IV osteogenesis imperfecta inherit a mutation from a parent who has the disorder. Most infants with more severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (such as type II and type III) have no history of the condition in their family. In these infants, the condition is caused by new (sporadic) mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene.  Less commonly, osteogenesis imperfecta has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Autosomal recessive inheritance means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder typically are not affected, but each carry one copy of the altered gene. Some cases of osteogenesis imperfecta type III are autosomal recessive; these cases usually result from mutations in genes other than COL1A1 and COL1A2. When osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the CRTAP or P3H1 gene, the condition also has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.) ",2531,7
"What is (are) osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome ? (Also called: OPPG; osteogenesis imperfecta, ocular form)","Osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome is a rare condition characterized by severe thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) and eye abnormalities that lead to vision loss. In people with this condition, osteoporosis is usually recognized in early childhood. It is caused by a shortage of minerals, such as calcium, in bones (decreased bone mineral density), which makes the bones brittle and prone to fracture. Affected individuals often have multiple bone fractures, including in the bones that form the spine (vertebrae). Multiple fractures can cause collapse of the affected vertebrae (compressed vertebrae), abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis), short stature, and limb deformities. Decreased bone mineral density can also cause softening or thinning of the skull (craniotabes).  Most affected individuals have impaired vision at birth or by early infancy and are blind by young adulthood. Vision problems are usually caused by one of several eye conditions, grouped together as pseudoglioma, that affect the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina), although other eye conditions have been identified in affected individuals. Pseudogliomas are so named because, on examination, the conditions resemble an eye tumor known as a retinal glioma.  Rarely, people with osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome have additional signs or symptoms such as mild intellectual disability, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), abnormally flexible joints, or seizures.)

What is (are) Osteogenesis Imperfecta ? (Also called: Brittle bone disease; OI),"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder in which bones break easily. Sometimes the bones break for no known reason. OI can also cause weak muscles, brittle teeth, a curved spine, and hearing loss. OI is caused by one of several genes that aren't working properly. When these genes don't work, it affects how you make collagen, a protein that helps make bones strong.     OI can range from mild to severe, and symptoms vary from person to person. A person may have just a few or as many as several hundred fractures in a lifetime.    No single test can identify OI. Your doctor uses your medical and family history, physical exam, and imaging and lab tests to diagnose it. Your doctor may also test your collagen (from skin) or genes (from blood). There is no cure, but you can manage symptoms. Treatments include exercise, pain medicine, physical therapy, wheelchairs, braces, and surgery.

How to diagnose Osteogenesis imperfecta ? (Also called: Brittle bone disease; Congenital disease; OI),"OI is most often suspected in children whose bones break with very little force. A physical exam may show that the whites of their eyes have a blue tint.  A definitive diagnosis may be made using a skin punch biopsy. Family members may be given a DNA blood test.  If there is a family history of OI, chorionic villus sampling  may be done during pregnancy to determine if the baby has the condition. However, because so many different mutations can cause OI, some forms cannot be diagnosed with a genetic test.  The severe form of type II OI can be seen on ultrasound when the fetus is as young as 16 weeks.) ",2534,5

What causes Cervical cancer ? (Also called: Cancer - cervix),"Worldwide, cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer in women. It is much less common in the United States because of the routine use of Pap smears.   Cervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are two types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar. Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells.  Cervical cancer usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called dysplasia. This condition can be detected by a Pap smear and is 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap smears, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap smear results.  Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV (human papillomavirus). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical cancer. Other strains can cause genital warts. Others do not cause any problems at all.  A woman's sexual habits and patterns can increase her risk of developing cervical cancer. Risky sexual practices include:   - Having sex at an early age  - Having multiple sexual partners  - Having a partner or many partners who take part in high-risk sexual activities    Other risk factors for cervical cancer include:  - Not getting the HPV vaccine  - Being economically disadvantaged  - Having a mother who took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy in the early 1960s to prevent miscarriage  - Having a weakened immune system) ",2536,2

What causes Cervical spondylosis ? (Also called: Cervical osteoarthritis; Arthritis - neck; Neck arthritis; Chronic neck pain; Degenerative disk disease),"Cervical spondylosis is caused by aging andchronic wear on the cervical spine. This includes the disks or cushions between the neck vertebrae and the joints between the bones of the cervical spine. There may be abnormal growths or spurs on the bones of the spine (vertebrae).  Over time, these changes can press down on (compress) one or more of the nerve roots. In advanced cases, the spinal cord becomes involved. This can affect not just the arms, but the legs as well.  Everyday wear and tear may start these changes. People who are very active at work or in sports may be more likely to have them.  The major risk factor is aging. By age 60, mostpeople show signs of cervical spondylosis on x-ray. Other factors that can make someone more likely to develop spondylosis are:  - Being overweight and not exercising  - Having a job that requires heavy lifting or a lot of bending and twisting  - Past neck injury (often several years before)  - Past spine surgery  - Ruptured or slipped disk  - Severe arthritis  - Small fractures to the spine from osteoporosis) ",2540,6
What causes Ear infection - acute ? (Also called: Otitis media - acute; Infection - inner ear; Middle ear infection - acute),"The eustachian tube runs from the middle of each ear to the back of the throat. Normally, this tube drains fluid that is made in the middle ear. If this tube gets blocked, fluid can build up. This can lead to infection.  - Ear infections are common in infants and children because the eustachian tubes are easily clogged.  - Ear infections can also occur in adults, although they are less common than in children.     Anything that causes the eustachian tubes to become swollen or blocked makes more fluid build up in the middle ear behind the eardrum. Some causes are:  - Allergies  - Colds and sinus infections  - Excess mucus and saliva produced during teething  - Infected or overgrown adenoids (lymph tissue in the upper part of the throat)  - Tobacco smoke    Ear infections are also more likely in children who spend a lot of time drinking from a sippy cup or bottle while lying on their back. Getting water in the ears will not cause an acute ear infection, unless the eardrum has a hole in it.  Acute ear infections most often occur in the winter. You cannot catch an ear infection from someone else. But a cold that spreads among children may cause some of them to get ear infections.  Risk factors for acute ear infections include:  - Attending day care (especially centers with more than 6 children)  - Changes in altitude or climate  - Cold climate  - Exposure to smoke  - Family history of ear infections  - Not being breastfed  - Pacifier use  - Recent ear infection  - Recent illness of any type (because illness lowers the body's resistance to infection)) ",2541,2
What are the symptoms of Ear infection - acute ? (Also called: Otitis media - acute; Infection - inner ear; Middle ear infection - acute),"In infants, often the main sign of an ear infection is acting irritable or crying that cannot be soothed. Many infants and children with an acute ear infection have a fever or trouble sleeping. Tugging on the ear is not always a sign that the child has an ear infection.  Symptoms of an acute ear infection in older children or adults include:  - Ear pain or earache  - Fullness in the ear  - Feeling of general illness  - Vomiting  - Diarrhea  - Hearing loss in the affected ear    The ear infection may start shortly after a cold. Sudden drainage of yellow or green fluid from the ear may mean the eardrum has ruptured.  All acute ear infections involve fluid behind the eardrum. At home, you can use an electronic ear monitor to check for this fluid. You can buy this device at a drugstore. You still need to see a health care provider to confirm an ear infection.) ",2542,2
What causes Ear infection - chronic ? (Also called: Middle ear infection - chronic; Otitis media - chronic; Chronic otitis media; Chronic ear infection),"The Eustachian tube runs from the middle of each ear to the back of the throat. This tube drains fluid made in the middle ear. If the Eustachian tube becomes blocked, fluid can build up. When this happens, infection can occur. A chronic ear infection develops when fluid or an infection behind the eardrum does not go away.    A chronic ear infection may be caused by:  - An acute ear infection that does not completely go away  - Repeated ear infections     ""Suppurative chronic otitis"" is a phrase health care providers use to describe an eardrum that keeps rupturing, draining, or swelling in the middle ear or mastoid area and does not go away.  Ear infections are more common in children because their Eustachian tubes are shorter, narrower, and more horizontal than in adults. Chronic ear infections are much less common than acute ear infections.) ",2543,2

What is (are) NICU consultants and support staff ?,"AUDIOLOGIST  An audiologist is trained to test a baby's hearing and provide follow-up care to those with hearing problems. Most newborns have their hearing screened before leaving the hospital. Your health care providers will determine which hearing test is best. Hearing tests may also be done after leaving the hospital.  CARDIOLOGIST  A cardiologist is a doctor that has special training in the diagnosis and treatment of heart and blood vessel disease. Pediatric cardiologists are trained to deal with newborn heart problems. The cardiologist may examine the baby, order tests, and read test results. Tests to diagnose heart conditions may include:  - X-ray  - Electrocardiogram (EKG)  - Echocardiogram  - Cardiac catheterization    If the structure of the heart is not normal due to a birth defect, a cardiologist might work with a cardiovascular surgeon to perform surgery on the heart.  CARDIOVASCULAR SURGEON  A cardiovascular (heart) surgeon is a doctor who has special training in doing surgery to correct or treat defects of the heart. Pediatric cardiovascular surgeons are trained to deal with newborn heart problems.   Sometimes, surgery can correct a heart problem. Other times, complete correction is not possible and surgery is done just to make the heart work as best as possible. The surgeon will work closely with the cardiologist to care for the baby before and after surgery.  DERMATOLOGIST  A dermatologist is a doctor who has special training in diseases and conditions of the skin, hair, and nails. Such a doctor might be asked to look at a rash or skin lesion on a baby in the hospital. In some cases, the dermatologist might take a sample of the skin, called a biopsy. The dermatologist might also work with the pathologist to read the biopsy results.  DEVELOPMENTAL PEDIATRICIAN  A developmental pediatrician is a doctor who has been specially trained to diagnose and care for infants who have trouble doing what other children their age can do. This type of doctor usually evaluates babies who have already gone home from the NICU and will order or perform developmental tests. The doctor can also help you find locate resources near your home that provide therapies to help infants and children in meeting development milestones. Developmental pediatricians work closely with nurse practitioners, occupational therapists, physical therapists, and sometimes neurologists.  DIETITIAN  A dietitian has special training in nutritional support (feeding). This type of provider may also specialize in pediatric (children's) nutritional care. Dietitians help determine if your baby is getting enough nutrients, and may recommend some choices of nutrition that can be given through the blood or a feeding tube.  ENDOCRINOLOGIST  A pediatric endocrinologist is a doctor with special training in the diagnosis and treatment of infants with hormone problems. Endocrinologists might be asked to see babies who have problems with the level of salt or sugar in the body, or who have problems with the development of certain glands and sexual organs.  GASTROENTEROLOGIST  A pediatric gastroenterologist is a doctor with special training in the diagnosis and treatment of infants with problems of the digestive system (stomach and intestines) and liver. This type of doctor might be asked to see a baby who has digestive or liver problems. Tests, such as x-rays, liver function tests, or abdominal ultrasounds, might be done.  GENETICIST  A geneticist is a doctor with special training in the diagnosis and treatment of infants with congenital (inherited) conditions, including chromosomal problems or syndromes. Tests, such as chromosome analysis, metabolic studies, and ultrasounds, may be done.  HEMATOLOGIST-ONCOLOGIST  A pediatric hematologist-oncologist is a doctor with special training in the diagnosis and treatment of children with blood disorders and types of cancer. This type of doctor might be asked to see a person for bleeding problems due to low platelets or other clotting factors. Tests, such as a complete blood count or clotting studies, might be ordered.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST  An infectious disease specialist is a doctor with special training in the diagnosis and treatment of infections. They might be asked to see a baby that develops unusual or serious infections. Infections in babies can include blood infections or infections of the brain and spinal cord.  MATERNAL-FETAL MEDICINE SPECIALIST  A maternal-fetal medicine doctor (perinatologist) is an obstetrician with special training in the care of high-risk pregnant women. High-risk means there is an increased chance of problems. This type of doctor can care for women who have premature labor, multiple gestations (twins or more), high blood pressure, or diabetes.  NEONATAL NURSE PRACTITIONER (NNP)  Neonatal nurse practitioners (NNP) are advanced practice nurses with extra experience in the care of newborn infants in addition to completing master's or doctoral level educational programs. The NNP works along with a neonatologist to diagnose and treat health problems in babies in the NICU. The NNP also performs procedures to help diagnose and manage certain conditions.  NEPHROLOGIST  A pediatric nephrologist is a doctor with special training in diagnosing and treating children who have problems with the kidneys and urinary system. This type of doctor might be asked to see a baby who has problems in the development of the kidneys or to help care for a baby whose kidneys do not work properly. If a baby needs kidney surgery, the nephrologist will work with a surgeon or urologist.  NEUROLOGIST  A pediatric neurologist is a doctor with special training in the diagnosis and treatment of children with disorders of the brain, nerves, and muscles. This type of doctor might be asked to see a baby who has seizures or bleeding in the brain. If the infant needs surgery for a problem in the brain or spinal cord, the neurologist might work with a neurosurgeon.  NEUROSURGEON  A pediatric neurosurgeon is a doctor trained as a surgeon who operates on children's brains and/or spinal cords. This type of doctor might be asked to see a baby who has problems, such as spina bifida, skull fracture, or hydrocephalus.

What causes Sinusitis ? (Also called: Acute sinusitis; Sinus infection; Sinusitis - acute; Sinusitis - chronic; Rhinosinusitis),"The sinuses are air-filled spaces in the skull. They are located behind the forehead, nasal bones, cheeks, and eyes. Healthy sinuses contain no bacteria or other germs. Most of the time, mucus is able to drain out and air is able to flow through the sinuses.   When the sinus openings become blocked or too much mucus builds up, bacteria and other germs can grow more easily.  Sinusitis can occur from one of these conditions:  - Small hairs (cilia) in the sinuses fail to properly to move mucus out. This may be due to some medical conditions.  - Colds and allergies may cause too much mucus to be made or block the opening of the sinuses.  - A deviated nasal septum, nasal bone spur, or nasal polyps may block the opening of the sinuses.     There are two types of sinusitis:  - Acute sinusitis is whensymptoms are present for 4 weeks or less. It is caused by bacteria growing in the sinuses.  - Chronic sinusitis is when swelling and inflammation of the sinuses are present for longer than 3 months.It may be caused by bacteria or a fungus.    The following may increase the risk that an adult or child will develop sinusitis:  - Allergic rhinitis or hay fever  - Cystic fibrosis  - Going to day care  - Diseases that prevent the cilia from working properly  - Changes in altitude (flying or scuba diving)  - Large adenoids  - Smoking  - Weakened immune system from HIV or chemotherapy) ",2546,5

A woman is most fertile in her early 20s. The chance a woman can get pregnant drops greatly after age 35 (and especially after age 40). The age when fertility starts to decline varies from woman to woman.  Infertility problems and miscarriage rates increase significantly after 35 year of age. There are now options for early egg retrieval and storage for women in their 20's. This will help ensure a successful pregnancy if childbearing is delayed until after age 35. This is an expensive option, but for women who know they will need to delay childbearing, it may be worth considering.) ",2567,0

When the egg with 2 copies of chromosome 21 unites with a normal sperm with one copy of chromosome 21 to form an embryo, the resulting embryo has 3 copies of chromosome 21 instead of the normal two. The extra chromosome is then copied in every cell of the baby's body, causing the features of Down syndrome. The cause of nondisjunction is unknown, but research has shown that it happens more often as women age. Nondisjunction is not known to be caused by anything in the environment or anything that parents do (or don't do) before or during pregnancy. Mosaic trisomy 21. In about 1-2% of cases, only some of the cells in a person's body have an extra chromosome 21; this is called ""mosaic trisomy 21"".  In this situation, the fertilized egg may have the right number of chromosomes, but due to a cell division error early in the development of the embryo, some cells ""acquire"" an extra chromosome 21. A person with mosaic trisomy 21 typically has 46 chromosomes in some cells, and 47 chromosomes (with the extra chromosome 21) in others. The features and severity in people with mosaic trisomy 21 may vary widely.  Translocation trisomy 21. About 3-4% of people with Down syndrome have cells that contain 46 chromosomes; however, there is extra chromosome 21 material attached (translocated ) onto another chromosome.  For parents of a child with Down syndrome due to a translocation, there may be an increased chance of Down syndrome in future pregnancies. This is because one of the two parents may be a carrier of a balanced translocation. However, not all parents of people with translocation trisomy 21 have a translocation. Regardless of the type of Down syndrome a person has, all people with Down syndrome have an extra, critical portion of chromosome 21 present in all or some of their cells. This extra genetic material disrupts the normal course of development, causing the characteristic features of Down syndrome.) ",2591,7

(Also called: complete trisomy 18 syndrome; Edwards syndrome; trisomy 18 syndrome; trisomy E syndrome),"Trisomy 18, also called Edwards syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 18 often have slow growth before birth (intrauterine growth retardation) and a low birth weight. Affected individuals may have heart defects and abnormalities of other organs that develop before birth. Other features of trisomy 18 include a small, abnormally shaped head; a small jaw and mouth; and clenched fists with overlapping fingers. Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many individuals with trisomy 18 die before birth or within their first month. Five to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year, and these children often have severe intellectual disability.) ",2595,10

What are the genetic changes related to trisomy 18 ? (Also called: complete trisomy 18 syndrome; Edwards syndrome; trisomy 18 syndrome; trisomy E syndrome),"Most cases of trisomy 18 result from having three copies of chromosome 18 in each cell in the body instead of the usual two copies. The extra genetic material disrupts the normal course of development, causing the characteristic features of trisomy 18.  Approximately 5 percent of people with trisomy 18 have an extra copy of chromosome 18 in only some of the body's cells. In these people, the condition is called mosaic trisomy 18. The severity of mosaic trisomy 18 depends on the type and number of cells that have the extra chromosome. The development of individuals with this form of trisomy 18 may range from normal to severely affected.  Very rarely, part of the long (q) arm of chromosome 18 becomes attached (translocated) to another chromosome during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or very early in embryonic development. Affected individuals have two copies of chromosome 18, plus the extra material from chromosome 18 attached to another chromosome. People with this genetic change are said to have partial trisomy 18. If only part of the q arm is present in three copies, the physical signs of partial trisomy 18 may be less severe than those typically seen in trisomy 18. If the entire q arm is present in three copies, individuals may be as severely affected as if they had three full copies of chromosome 18.) ",2597,7
Is trisomy 18 inherited ? (Also called: complete trisomy 18 syndrome; Edwards syndrome; trisomy 18 syndrome; trisomy E syndrome),"Most cases of trisomy 18 are not inherited, but occur as random events during the formation of eggs and sperm. An error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes. For example, an egg or sperm cell may gain an extra copy of chromosome 18. If one of these atypical reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have an extra chromosome 18 in each of the body's cells.  Mosaic trisomy 18 is also not inherited. It occurs as a random event during cell division early in embryonic development. As a result, some of the body's cells have the usual two copies of chromosome 18, and other cells have three copies of this chromosome.  Partial trisomy 18 can be inherited. An unaffected person can carry a rearrangement of genetic material between chromosome 18 and another chromosome. This rearrangement is called a balanced translocation because there is no extra material from chromosome 18. Although they do not have signs of trisomy 18, people who carry this type of balanced translocation are at an increased risk of having children with the condition.) ",2598,7

What is (are) High Blood Pressure ?,"High blood pressure is a common disease in which blood flows through blood vessels (arteries) at higher than normal pressures. What Is Blood Pressure? Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the blood vessels as the heart pumps blood. If your blood pressure rises and stays high over time, its called high blood pressure. High blood pressure is dangerous because it makes the heart work too hard, and the high force of the blood flow can harm arteries and organs such as the heart, kidneys, brain, and eyes. Types of High Blood Pressure There are two main types of high blood pressure: primary and secondary high blood pressure. - Primary, or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. This type of high blood pressure tends to develop over years as a person ages.   - Secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. This type usually resolves after the cause is treated or removed. Primary, or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. This type of high blood pressure tends to develop over years as a person ages. Secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. This type usually resolves after the cause is treated or removed. Measuring Blood Pressure Blood pressure is always given as two numbers, the systolic and diastolic pressures. Both are important. - Systolic Pressure  is the pressure of blood against the artery walls when the heart beats.  -  Diastolic Pressure is the pressure of blood against the artery walls when the heart is at rest between beats. Systolic Pressure  is the pressure of blood against the artery walls when the heart beats.  Diastolic Pressure is the pressure of blood against the artery walls when the heart is at rest between beats. Usually these numbers are written one above or before the other -- for example, 120/80 mmHg. The top, or first, number is the systolic and the bottom, or second number, is the diastolic. If your blood pressure is 120/80, you say that it is ""120 over 80."" Normal Blood Pressure Normal blood pressure for adults is defined as a systolic pressure below 120 mmHg and a diastolic pressure below 80 mmHg. It is normal for blood pressures to change when you sleep, wake up, or are excited or nervous. When you are active, it is normal for your blood pressure to increase. However, once the activity stops, your blood pressure returns to your normal baseline range. Blood pressure normally rises with age and body size. Newborn babies often have very low blood pressure numbers that are considered normal for babies, while older teens have numbers similar to adults. Abnormal Blood Pressure Abnormal blood pressure is higher than 120/80 mmHg. If either your systolic or diastolic blood pressure is higher than normal (120/80) but not high enough to be considered high blood pressure (140/90), you have pre-hypertension. Pre-hypertension is a top number between 120 and 139 or a bottom number between 80 and 89 mmHg. For example, blood pressure readings of 138/82, 128/70, or 115/86 are all in the ""pre-hypertension"" range. (Click the table on the right to see the stages of high blood pressure in adults.) A systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or higher, or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or higher, is considered high blood pressure, or hypertension. Hypertension is the medical term for high blood pressure. If you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, your recommended blood pressure levels are a systolic blood pressure of 130 mmHg or lower, and a diastolic blood pressure of 80 mmHg or lower. Usually Has No Symptoms High blood pressure is often called ""the silent killer"" because it usually has no symptoms. Occasionally, headaches may occur. Some people may not find out they have high blood pressure until they have trouble with their heart, kidneys, or eyes. When high blood pressure is not diagnosed and treated, it can lead to other life-threatening conditions, including heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and kidney failure. It can also lead to vision changes or blindness. Possible Complications Over Time Over time, high blood pressure can cause - your heart to work too hard and become larger or weaker, which can lead to heart failure.   - small bulges (aneurysms) to worsen in your blood vessels. Common locations for aneurysms are the aorta, which is the main artery from the heart; the arteries in your brain, legs, and intestines; and the artery leading to your spleen.  - blood vessels in your kidneys to narrow, which can cause kidney failure.  - blood vessels in your eyes to burst or bleed, which can cause vision changes and can result in blindness.   - arteries throughout your body to ""harden"" faster, especially those in your heart, brain, kidneys, and legs.

What causes High Blood Pressure ?,"Changes in Body Functions Researchers continue to study how various changes in normal body functions cause high blood pressure. The key functions affected in high blood pressure include -  kidney fluid and salt balances  -  the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system   - the sympathetic nervous system activity   - blood vessel structure and function. kidney fluid and salt balances the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system the sympathetic nervous system activity blood vessel structure and function. Kidney Fluid and Salt Balances The kidneys normally regulate the bodys salt balance by retaining sodium and water and eliminating potassium. Imbalances in this kidney function can expand blood volumes, which can cause high blood pressure. Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system makes angiotensin and aldosterone hormones. Angiotensin narrows or constricts blood vessels, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure. Aldosterone controls how the kidneys balance fluid and salt levels. Increased aldosterone levels or activity may change this kidney function, leading to increased blood volumes and high blood pressure. Sympathetic Nervous System Activity The sympathetic nervous system has important functions in blood pressure regulation, including heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate. Researchers are investigating whether imbalances in this system cause high blood pressure. Blood Vessel Structure and Function Changes in the structure and function of small and large arteries may contribute to high blood pressure. The angiotensin pathway and the immune system may stiffen small and large arteries, which can affect blood pressure. Genetic Causes High blood pressure often runs in families. Years of research have identified many genes and other mutations associated with high blood pressure. However, known genetic factors only account for 2 to 3 percent of all cases. Emerging research suggests that certain DNA changes before birth also may cause the development of high blood pressure later in life. Unhealthy Lifestyle Habits Unhealthy lifestyle habits can cause high blood pressure, including - high sodium intake and sodium sensitivity  - drinking too much alcohol  - lack of physical activity. high sodium intake and sodium sensitivity drinking too much alcohol lack of physical activity. Overweight and Obesity Research studies show that being overweight or obese can increase the resistance in the blood vessels, causing the heart to work harder and leading to high blood pressure. Medicines Prescription medicines such as asthma or hormone therapies (including birth control pills and estrogen) and over-the-counter medicines such as cold relief medicines may cause high blood pressure. This happens because medicines can - change the way your body controls fluid and salt balances  - cause your blood vessels to constrict  -  impact the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, leading to high blood pressure.  change the way your body controls fluid and salt balances cause your blood vessels to constrict impact the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, leading to high blood pressure.

The angiotensin pathway and the immune system may stiffen small and large arteries, which can affect blood pressure. Genetic Causes High blood pressure often runs in families. Years of research have identified many genes and other mutations associated with high blood pressure. However, known genetic factors only account for 2 to 3 percent of all cases. Emerging research suggests that certain DNA changes before birth also may cause the development of high blood pressure later in life. Unhealthy Lifestyle Habits Unhealthy lifestyle habits can cause high blood pressure, including - high sodium intake and sodium sensitivity  - drinking too much alcohol  - lack of physical activity. high sodium intake and sodium sensitivity drinking too much alcohol lack of physical activity. Overweight and Obesity Research studies show that being overweight or obese can increase the resistance in the blood vessels, causing the heart to work harder and leading to high blood pressure. Medicines Prescription medicines such as asthma or hormone therapies (including birth control pills and estrogen) and over-the-counter medicines such as cold relief medicines may cause high blood pressure. This happens because medicines can - change the way your body controls fluid and salt balances  - cause your blood vessels to constrict  -  impact the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, leading to high blood pressure.  change the way your body controls fluid and salt balances cause your blood vessels to constrict impact the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, leading to high blood pressure. Other Causes Other causes of high blood pressure include medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease, sleep apnea, thyroid problems, or certain tumors. These conditions can change the way your body controls fluids, sodium, and hormones in your blood, which leads to secondary high blood pressure.) ",2619,5

A procedure or medicine that falls under this category should be avoided.    Some treatments may cause unwanted or dangerous reactions in people with allergies, high blood pressure, or pregnancy. For example, isotretinoin, a drug used to treat acne is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy due to the risk of birth defects. Certain decongestants are contraindicated in people with high blood pressure and should be avoided.  Many medicines should not be used together by the same person.

Do you have information about Nicotine replacement therapy (Also called: Smoking cessation - nicotine replacement; Tobacco - nicotine replacement therapy),"Nicotine replacement therapy is a treatment to help people stop smoking. It uses products that supply low doses of nicotine. These products do not contain many of the toxins found in smoke. The goal of therapy is to cut down on cravings for nicotine and ease the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.   Facts about using nicotine replacement therapy:  - The more cigarettes you smoke, the higher the dose you may need to start.  - Adding a counseling program will make you more likely to quit.  - DO NOT smoke while using nicotine replacement. It can cause nicotine to build up to toxic levels.  - Nicotine replacement helps prevent weight gain while you are using it. You may still gain weight when you stop all nicotine use.  - The dose of nicotine should be slowly decreased.   TYPES OF NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY  Nicotine supplements come in many forms:  - Gum  - Inhalers  - Lozenges  - Nasal spray  - Skin patch    All of these work well if they are used correctly. People are more likely to use the gum and patches correctly than other forms.  Nicotine Patch  All nicotine patches are placed and used in similar ways:  - A single patch is worn each day. It is replaced after 24 hours.  - Place the patch on different areas above the waist and below the neck each day.  - Put the patch on a hairless spot.  - People who wear the patches for 24 hours will have fewer withdrawal symptoms.  - If wearing the patch at night causes odd dreams, try sleeping without the patch.  - People who smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes per day should start with a lower dose patch (for example, 14 mg).    Nicotine Gum or Lozenge  You can buy nicotine gum or lozenges without a prescription. Some people prefer lozenges to the patch, because they can control the nicotine dose.  Tips for using the gum:  - If you are just starting to quit, chew 1 to 2 pieces each hour. DO NOT chew more than 20 pieces a day.  - Chew the gum slowly until it develops a peppery taste. Then, tuck it between the gum and cheek and store it there. This lets the nicotine be absorbed.  - The goal is to stop using the gum by 6 months. Using nicotine gum long-term may be safer than smoking, but research is needed to confirm this.  - Wait at least 15 minutes after drinking coffee, tea, soft drinks, and acidic beverages before chewing a piece of gum.  - People who smoke more than 25 cigarettes per day have better results with the 4 mg dose than with the 2 mg dose.    Nicotine Inhaler  The nicotine inhaler looks like a plastic cigarette holder. It requires a prescription in the United States.  - Insert nicotine cartridges into the inhaler and ""puff"" for about 20 minutes. Do this up to 16 times a day.  - The inhaler is quick-acting. It takes about the same time as the gum to act. It is faster than the 2 to 4 hours it takes for the patch to work.  - The inhaler satisfies oral urges.  - Most of the nicotine vapor does not go into the airways of the lung. Some people have mouth or throat irritation and cough with the inhaler.    It can help to use the inhaler and patch together when quitting.  Nicotine Nasal Spray  The nasal spray provides a quick dose of nicotine to satisfy a craving you are unable to ignore. Levels of nicotine peak within 5 to 10 minutes after using the spray.   - It may be used along with the patch.  - The spray can irritate the nose, eyes, and throat. These side effects often go away in a few days.   SIDE EFFECTS AND RISKS  All nicotine products may cause side effects. Symptoms are more likely when you use very high doses. Reducing the dose can prevent these symptoms. Side effects include:  - Headaches  - Nausea and other digestive problems  - Problems getting to sleep in the first few days, most often with the patch. This problem usually passes.   SPECIAL CONCERNS  Nicotine patches are okay for use by most people with stable heart or blood circulation problems. But, the unhealthy cholesterol levels (lower HDL level) caused by smoking do not get better until the nicotine patch is stopped.  Nicotine replacement may not be completely safe in pregnant women. The unborn children of women who use the patch may have a faster heart rate.  Keep all nicotine products away from children.   - The concern is greater for small children. Nicotine is a poison.  - Call the doctor or a poison control center right away if a child has been exposed to a nicotine replacement product, even for a short time.) ",2650,6

However, you will form a reaction after future exposures. You may become more sensitive and develop a reaction if you use it regularly. The reaction most often occurs 24 to 48 hours after the exposure.   Some products cause a reaction only when the skin is also exposed to sunlight (photosensitivity). These include:  - Shaving lotions  - Sunscreens  - Sulfa ointments  - Some perfumes  - Coal tar products  - Oil from the skin of a lime    A few airborne allergens, such as ragweed or insecticide spray, can also cause contact dermatitis.)

Hair products, cosmetics, and perfumes can lead to skin reactions on the face, head, and neck. Jewelry can also cause skin problems in the area under it.  Itching is a common symptom. In the case of an allergic dermatitis, itching can be severe.   You may have red, streaky, or patchy rash where the substance touched the skin. The allergic reaction is often delayed so that the rash may not appear until 24 to 48 hours after exposure.   The rash may:  - Have red bumps that may form moist, weeping blisters  - Feel warm and tender  - Ooze, drain, or crust  - Become scaly, raw, or thickened    Dermatitis caused by an irritant may also cause burning or pain as well as itching.

Allergy testing with skin patches (called patch testing) may determine what is causing the reaction. Patch testing is used for certain people who have long-term or repeated contact dermatitis. It requires 3 office visits and must be done by a provider with the skill to interpret the results correctly.   - On the first visit, small patches of possible allergens are applied to the skin. These patches are removed 48 hours later to see if a reaction has occurred.  - A third visit, about 2 days later, is done to look for any delayed reaction.  - If you have already tested a material on a small area of your skin and noticed a reaction, you should bring the material with you.    Other tests may be used to rule out other possible causes, including skin lesion biopsy or culture of the skin lesion.) ",2694,10
What are the treatments for Contact dermatitis ? (Also called: Dermatitis - contact; Allergic dermatitis; Dermatitis - allergic; Irritant contact dermatitis; Skin rash - contact dermatitis),"Your doctor will recommend treatment based on what is causing the problem. In some cases, the best treatment is to do nothing to the area.  Often, treatment includes washing the area with a lot of water to get rid of any traces of the irritant that are still on the skin. You should avoid further exposure to the substance.  Emollients or moisturizers help keep the skin moist, and also help skin repair itself. They protect the skin from becoming inflamed again. They are a key part of preventing and treating contact dermatitis.  Topical corticosteroids are medicines used to treat eczema.  - Topical means you place it on the skin. You will be prescribed a cream or ointment. Topical corticosteroids may also be called topical steroids or topical cortisones.  - DO NOT use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor advises you to use it.    Your provider may also prescribe other creams or ointments, such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus, to use on the skin.  In severe cases, you may need to take corticosteroid pills.

how can botulism be prevented?,"Many cases of botulism are preventable. Foodborne botulism has often been from home-canned foods with low acid content, such as asparagus, green beans, beets and corn and is caused by failure to follow proper canning methods. However, seemingly unlikely or unusual sources are found every decade, with the common problem of improper handling during manufacture, at retail, or by consumers; some examples are chopped garlic in oil, canned cheese sauce, chile peppers, tomatoes, carrot juice, and baked potatoes wrapped in foil. In Alaska, foodborne botulism is caused by fermented fish and other aquatic game foods. Persons who do home canning should follow strict hygienic procedures to reduce contamination of foods, and carefully follow instructions on safe home canning including the use of pressure canners/cookers as recommended through county extension services or from the US Department of Agriculture. Oils infused with garlic or herbs should be refrigerated. Potatoes which have been baked while wrapped in aluminum foil should be kept hot until served or refrigerated. Because the botulinum toxin is destroyed by high temperatures, persons who eat home-canned foods should consider boiling the food for 10 minutes before eating it to ensure safety. Wound botulism can be prevented by promptly seeking medical care for infected wounds and by not using injectable street drugs. Most infant botulism cases cannot be prevented because the bacteria that causes this disease is in soil and dust.  The bacteria can be found inside homes on floors, carpet, and countertops even after cleaning.  Honey can contain the bacteria that causes infant botulism so, children less than 12 months old should not be fed honey. Honey is safe for persons 1 year of age and older.) ",2704,4

However, as of October 2010, all VISA and VRSA isolates have been susceptible to other Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Persons who develop this type of staph infection may have underlying health conditions (such as diabetes and kidney disease), tubes going into their bodies (such as catheters), previous infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and recent exposure to vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents. What is Staphylococcus aureus? Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium commonly found on the skin and in the nose of about 30% of individuals. Most of the time, staph does not cause any harm. These infections can look like pimples, boils, or other skin conditions and most are able to be treated. Sometimes staph bacteria can get into the bloodstream and cause serious infections which can be fatal, including: Bacteremia or sepsis when bacteria spread to the bloodstream usually as a result of using catheters or having surgery. Pneumonia which predominantly affects people with underlying lung disease including those on mechanical ventilators. Endocarditis (infection of the heart valves) which can lead to heart failure. Osteomyelitis (bone infection) which can be caused by staph bacteria traveling in the bloodstream or put there by direct contact such as following trauma (puncture wound of foot or intravenous (IV) drug abuse). Top of page How do VISA and VRSA get their names? Staph bacteria are classified as VISA or VRSA based on laboratory tests. Laboratories perform tests to determine if staph bacteria are resistant to antimicrobial agents that might be used for treatment of infections. For vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents, laboratories determine how much of the agent it requires to inhibit the growth of the organism in a test tube. The result of the test is usually expressed as a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or the minimum amount of antimicrobial agent that inhibits bacterial growth in the test tube. Therefore, staph bacteria are classified as VISA if the MIC for vancomycin is 4-8쨉g/ml, and classified as VRSA if the vancomycin MIC is ??6쨉g/ml. Top of page What should a patient do if they suspect they have a staph, MRSA, VISA, or VRSA infection? See a healthcare provider. Top of page Are VISA and VRSA infections treatable? Yes. As of October 2010, all VISA and VRSA isolates have been susceptible to several Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Top of page How can the spread of VISA and VRSA be prevented? Use of appropriate infection control practices (such as wearing gloves before and after contact with infectious body substances and adherence to hand hygiene) by healthcare personnel can reduce the spread of VISA and VRSA. Top of page What should a person do if a family member or close friend has VISA or VRSA? VISA and VRSA are types of antibiotic-resistant staph bacteria. Therefore, as with all staph bacteria, spread occurs among people having close physical contact with infected patients or contaminated material, such as bandages. Persons having close physical contact with infected patients while they are outside of the healthcare setting should: (1) keep their hands clean by washing thoroughly with soap and water, and (2) avoid contact with other people's wounds or material contaminated from wounds. If they go to the hospital to visit a friend or family member who is infected with VISA or VRSA , they must follow the hospital's recommended precautions. Top of page What is CDC doing to address VISA and VRSA? In addition to providing guidance for clinicians and infection control personnel, CDC is also working with state and local health agencies, healthcare facilities, and clinical microbiology laboratories to ensure that laboratories are using proper methods to detect VISA and VRSA. Top of page Recommendations and Guidelines CDC issued a Clinical Reminder, in 2010, which serves as a reminder about the important role of clinical laboratories in the diagnosis of VRSA cases to ensure prompt recognition, isolation, and management by infection control personnel.

What is the treatment for vancomycin-resistant enterococci? How is vancomycin-resistant enterococci spread? How can patients prevent the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci? What should a patient do if they think they have vancomycin-resistant enterococci? Recommendations and Guidelines General Information For more images of this bacterium, search the Public Health Image Library What is vancomycin-resistant enterococci? Enteroccocci are bacteria that are normally present in the human intestines and in the female genital tract and are often found in the environment. These bacteria can sometimes cause infections. Vancomycin is an antibiotic that is used to treat some drug-resistant infections caused by enterococci. In some instances, enterococci have become resistant to this drug and thus are called vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Most VRE infections occur in hospitals. Top of page What types of infections does VRE cause? VRE can live in the human intestines and female genital tract without causing disease (often called colonization). However, sometimes it can cause infections of the urinary tract, the bloodstream, or of wounds associated with catheters or surgical procedures. Top of page Are certain people at risk of getting VRE? The following persons are at increased risk becoming infected with VRE: People who have been previously treated with the antibiotic vancomycin or other antibiotics for long periods of time. People who are hospitalized, particularly when they receive antibiotic treatment for long periods of time. People with weakened immune systems such as patients in intensive care units, or in cancer or transplant wards. People who have undergone surgical procedures such as abdominal or chest surgery. People with medical devices that stay in for some time such as urinary catheters or central intravenous (IV) catheters. People who are colonized with VRE. Top of page What is the treatment for VRE? People with colonized VRE (bacteria are present, but have no symptoms of an infection)  do not need treatment. Most VRE infections can be treated with antibiotics other than vancomycin. Laboratory testing of the VRE can determine which antibiotics will work. For people who get VRE infections in their bladder and have urinary catheters, removal of the catheter when it is no longer needed can also help get rid of the infection. Top of page How is VRE spread? VRE is often passed from person to person by the contaminated hands of caregivers. VRE can get onto a caregiver's hands after they have contact with other people with VRE or after contact with contaminated surfaces. VRE can also be spread directly to people after they touch surfaces that are contaminated with VRE. VRE is not spread through the air by coughing or sneezing. Top of page How can patients prevent the spread of VRE? If a patient or someone in their household has VRE, the following are some things they can do to prevent the spread of VRE: Keep their hands clean. Always wash their hands thoroughly after using the bathroom and before preparing food. Clean their hands after contact with persons who have VRE. Wash with soap and water (particularly when visibly soiled) or use alcohol-based hand rubs. Frequently clean areas of the home, such as bathrooms, that may become contaminated with VRE. Wear gloves if hands may come in contact with body fluids that may contain VRE, such as stool or bandages from infected wounds. Always wash their hands after removing gloves. If someone has VRE, be sure to tell healthcare providers so that they are aware of the infection. Healthcare facilities use special precautions to help prevent the spread of VRE to others. Top of page What should patients do if they think they have vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)? Anyone who thinks they have VRE must talk with their healthcare provider.

Who should get Insulin Injection and why is it prescribed ?,"Insulin injection is used to control blood sugar in people who have type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not make insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or in people who have type 2 diabetes (condition in which the blood sugar is too high because the body does not produce or use insulin normally) that cannot be controlled with oral medications alone. Insulin injection is in a class of medications called hormones. Insulin injection is used to take the place of insulin that is normally produced by the body. It works by helping move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. It also stops the liver from producing more sugar. All of the types of insulin that are available work in this way. The types of insulin differ only in how quickly they begin to work and how long they continue to control blood sugar.  Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Using medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease.

Who should get Insulin Lispro Injection and why is it prescribed ?,"Insulin lispro is used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). It is also used to treat people with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) who need insulin to control their diabetes. In patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin lispro is always used with another type of insulin, unless it is used in an external insulin pump. In patients with type 2 diabetes, insulin lispro may be used with another type of insulin or with oral medication(s) for diabetes. Insulin lispro is a short-acting, man-made version of human insulin. Insulin lispro works by replacing the insulin that is normally produced by the body and by helping move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy.

(Also called: cutis gyrata syndrome of Beare and Stevenson; cutis gyrata syndrome of Beare-Stevenson),"Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by skin abnormalities and the premature fusion of certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis). This early fusion prevents the skull from growing normally and affects the shape of the head and face.  Many of the characteristic facial features of Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome result from the premature fusion of the skull bones. The head is unable to grow normally, which leads to a cloverleaf-shaped skull, wide-set and bulging eyes, ear abnormalities, and an underdeveloped upper jaw. Early fusion of the skull bones also affects the growth of the brain, causing delayed development and intellectual disability.  A skin abnormality called cutis gyrata is also characteristic of this disorder. The skin has a furrowed and wrinkled appearance, particularly on the face, near the ears, and on the palms and soles of the feet. Additionally, thick, dark, velvety areas of skin (acanthosis nigricans) are sometimes found on the hands and feet and in the genital region.  Additional signs and symptoms of Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome can include a blockage of the nasal passages (choanal atresia), overgrowth of the umbilical stump (tissue that normally falls off shortly after birth, leaving the belly button), and abnormalities of the genitalia and anus.

What causes Plantar fasciitis ?,"Plantar fasciitis occurs when the thick band of tissue on the bottom of the foot is overstretched or overused. This can be painful and make walking more difficult.   You are more likely to get plantar fasciitis if you:   - Have foot arch problems (both flat feet and high arches)  - Run long distances, downhill or on uneven surfaces  - Are obese or gain weight suddenly   - Have a tight Achilles tendon (the tendon connecting the calf muscles to the heel)  - Wear shoes with poor arch support or soft soles  - Change your activities   Plantar fasciitis is seen in both men and women. However, it most often affects active men ages 40 - 70. It is one of the most common orthopedic foot complaints.   Plantar fasciitis was commonly thought to be caused by a heel spur. However, research has found that this is not the case. On x-ray, heel spurs are seen in people with and without plantar fasciitis.) ",2742,4

Hepatocellular carcinoma is not the same as metastatic liver cancer, which starts in another organ (such as the breast or colon) and spreads to the liver.  In most cases, the cause of liver cancer is long-term damage and scarring of the liver (cirrhosis). Cirrhosis may be caused by:  - Alcohol abuse  - Autoimmune diseases of the liver  - Hepatitis B or C virus infection  - Inflammation of the liver that is long-term (chronic)  - Iron overload in the body (hemochromatosis)   People with hepatitis B or C are at high risk of liver cancer, even if theydo not develop cirrhosis.)

How to diagnose Childhood Liver Cancer ?,"Tests that examine the liver and the blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood liver cancer and find out whether the cancer has spread. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Serum tumor marker test : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers. The blood of children who have liver cancer may have increased amounts of a hormone called beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG) or a protein called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Other cancers and certain noncancer conditions, including cirrhosis and hepatitis, can also increase AFP levels.    -   Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:                - The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.      - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      - The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.             -   Liver function tests : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of liver damage or cancer.    -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as bilirubin or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.     -   Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) test: A blood test to check for antibodies to the EBV and DNA markers of the EBV. These are found in the blood of patients who have been infected with EBV.    -  Hepatitis assay : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked for pieces of the hepatitis virus.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the liver. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. In childhood liver cancer, an ultrasound exam of the abdomen to check the large blood vessels is usually done.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. In childhood liver cancer, a CT scan of the chest and abdomen is usually done.    -   Abdominal x-ray : An x-ray of the organs in the abdomen. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   Biopsy : The removal of a sample of cells or tissues so it can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. The sample may be taken during surgery to remove or view the tumor. A pathologist looks at the sample under a microscope to find out the type of liver cancer.  The following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:               -  Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test is used to check for a certain gene mutation and to tell the difference between different types of cancer.) ",2761,5

What causes Abscess ?,"Abscesses occur when an area of tissue becomes infected and the body's immune system tries to fight it. White blood cells move through the walls of the blood vessels into the area of the infection and collect in the damaged tissue. During this process, pus forms. Pus is the buildup of fluid, living and dead white blood cells, dead tissue, and bacteria or other foreign substances.  Abscesses can form in almost any part of the body. The skin, under the skin, and the teeth are the most common sites. Abscesses may be caused by bacteria, parasites, and foreign substances.  Abscesses in the skin are easy to see. They are red, raised, and painful. Abscesses in other areas of the body may not beseen, but they may cause organ damage.  Types of abscesses include:  - Abdominal abscess  - Amebic liver abscess  - Anorectal abscess  - Bartholin abscess  - Brain abscess  - Epidural abscess  - Peritonsillar abscess  - Pyogenic liver abscess  - Skin abscess  - Spinal cord abscess  - Subcutaneous abscess  - Tooth abscess) ",2765,6

The following factors increase your risk of an anorectal abscess:  - Anal sex  - Chemotherapy drugs used to treat cancer  - Diabetes  - Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis)  - Use of corticosteroid medicines  - Weakened immune system (such as from HIV/AIDS)   The condition may occur in infants and toddlers who are still in diapers and who have a history of anal fissures.) ,2766,6
What causes Brain abscess ? (Also called: Abscess - brain; Cerebral abscess; CNS abscess),"Brain abscesses commonly occur when bacteria or fungi infect part of the brain. As a result, swelling and irritation (inflammation) develop. Infected brain cells, white blood cells, live and dead bacteria, or fungi collect in an area of the brain. Tissue forms around this area and creates a mass, or abscess.  The germs that cause a brain abscess can reach the brain through the blood. Or, they enter the brain directly, such as during brain surgery.  The source of the infection is often not found. However, the most common source is a lung infection. Less often, a heart infection is the cause.   The following raise your chance of developing a brain abscess:  - A weakened immune system (such as in AIDS patients)  - Chronic disease, such as cancer  - Drugs that suppress the immune system (corticosteroids or chemotherapy)  - Congenital heart disease) ",2767,3
What causes Epidural abscess ? (Also called: Abscess - epidural; Spinal abscess),"Epidural abscess is a rare disorder caused by infection in the area between the bones of the skull, or spine, and the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (meninges). This infection is called an intracranial epidural abscess if it is inside the skull area. It is called a spinal epidural abscess if it is found in the spine area. Most are located in the spine.  The spinal infection is usually caused by bacteria, but may be caused by a fungus. It can be due to other infections in the body (especially a urinary tract infection), or germs that spread through the blood. In some people, though, no other source of infection is found.  An abscess inside the skull is called an intracranial epidural abscess. The cause may be any of the following:  - Chronic ear infections  - Chronic sinusitis  - Head injury  - Mastoiditis  - Recent neurosurgery    An abscess of the spine is called a spinal epidural abscess. It may be seen in people with any of the following:  - Had back surgery or another invasive procedure involving the spine  - Bloodstream infections  - Boils especially on the back or scalp  - Bone infections of the spine (vertebral osteomyelitis)    People who inject drugs are also at increased risk.)

What causes Perirenal abscess ? (Also called: Perinephric abscess),"Most perirenal abscesses are caused by urinary tract infections that start in the bladder. They then spread to the kidney, and to the area around the kidney. Surgery in the urinary tract or reproductive system and a bloodstream infection can also lead to a perirenal abscess.  The biggest risk factor for perirenal abscess is kidney stones, by blockage of urine flow. This provides a place for an infection to grow. Bacteria tend to stick to the stones and antibiotics cannnot kill the bacteria there.  Stones are found in 20to 60% of patients with perirenal abscess. Other risk factors for perirenal abscess include:  - Diabetes  - Having an abnormal urinary tract  - Trauma  - IV drug use) ",2769,0

What causes Tooth abscess ? (Also called: Periapical abscess; Dental abscess; Tooth infection; Abscess - tooth),A tooth abscess is a complication of tooth decay. It may also occur when a tooth is broken or chipped. Openings in the tooth enamel allow bacteria to infect the center of the tooth (the pulp). Infection may spread from the root of the tooth to the bones supporting the tooth.  Infection results in a collection of pus and tissue swelling within the tooth. This causes a painful toothache. The toothache may stop if the pulp of the tooth dies unless an abscess develops. The infection can remain active and continue to spread causing more pain and destroying tissue.) ,2773,8

What is (are) Heart Attack ?,"Blood Flow to the Heart Is Blocked The heart works 24 hours a day, pumping oxygen and nutrient-rich blood to the body. Blood is supplied to the heart through its coronary arteries. If a blood clot suddenly blocks a coronary artery, it cuts off most or all blood supply to the heart, and a heart attack results. If blood flow isn't restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die. The more time that passes without treatment to restore blood flow, the greater the damage to the heart. Affects Both Men and Women Heart attacks are a leading killer of both men and women in the United States. Each year, more than one million people in the U.S. have a heart attack and about half of them die. Half of those who die do so within one hour of the start of symptoms and before reaching the hospital. The good news is that excellent treatments are available for heart attacks. These treatments can save lives and prevent disabilities. Prompt Treatment Is Important Heart attack treatment works best when it's given right after symptoms occur. Prompt treatment of a heart attack can help prevent or limit damage to the heart and prevent sudden death. Call 9-1-1 Right Away A heart attack is an emergency. Call 9-1-1 for an ambulance right away -- within 5 minutes -- if you think you or someone else may be having a heart attack. You also should call for help if your chest pain doesn't go away as it usually does when you take medicine prescribed for angina (chest pain). Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Emergency personnel in the ambulance can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room. They carry drugs and equipment that can help your medical condition, including - oxygen   - aspirin to prevent further blood clotting   - heart medications, such as nitroglycerin   - pain relief treatments  - defibrillators that can restart the heart if it stops beating.  oxygen aspirin to prevent further blood clotting heart medications, such as nitroglycerin pain relief treatments defibrillators that can restart the heart if it stops beating.

What causes Heart Attack ?,"Most heart attacks are caused by a blood clot that blocks one of the coronary arteries, the blood vessels that bring blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. When blood cannot reach part of your heart, that area starves for oxygen. If the blockage continues long enough, cells in the affected area die. The Most Common Cause Coronary heart disease (CHD)is the most common underlying cause of a heart attack. CHD, also called coronary artery disease, is the hardening and narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by the buildup of plaque inside the walls of the arteries. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis (ath-er-o-skler-O-sis). The buildup of plaque occurs over many years. Over time, an area of plaque can rupture (break open) inside of an artery. This causes a blood clot to form on the plaque's surface. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery. If the blockage isn't treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. Healthy heart tissue is replaced with scar tissue. This heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems. Other Causes Heart attack also can occur due to problems with the very small, microscopic blood vessels of the heart. This condition is called microvascular disease. It's believed to be more common in women than in men. A less common cause of heart attacks is a severe spasm or tightening of the coronary artery that cuts off blood flow to the heart. These spasms can occur in persons with or without coronary artery disease. What causes a coronary artery to spasm isn't always clear. A spasm may be related to emotional stress or pain, exposure to extreme cold, cigarette smoking, or by taking certain drugs like cocaine. Risk Factors You Cannot Change Certain factors make it more likely that you will develop coronary artery disease and have a heart attack. These risk factors include some things you cannot change. If you are a man over age 45 or a woman over age 55, you are at greater risk. Having a family history of early heart disease, diagnosed in a father or brother before age 55 or in a mother or sister before age 65, is another risk factor. You are also at risk if you have a personal history of angina or previous heart attack, or if you have had a heart procedure such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Risk Factors You Can Change Importantly, there are many risk factors that you can change. These include - smoking  - being overweight or obese  - physical inactivity  - high blood pressure  - high blood cholesterol  - high blood sugar due to insulin resistance or diabetes   - an unhealthy diet (for example, a diet high in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, and sodium). smoking being overweight or obese physical inactivity high blood pressure high blood cholesterol high blood sugar due to insulin resistance or diabetes an unhealthy diet (for example, a diet high in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, and sodium). Metabolic Syndrome Some of these risk factorssuch as obesity, high blood pressure, and high blood sugartend to occur together. When they do, it's called metabolic syndrome. In general, a person with metabolic syndrome is twice as likely to develop heart disease and five times as likely to develop diabetes as someone without metabolic syndrome.) ",2790,0
What causes Heart Attack ?,"Coronary heart disease, or CHD, is the most common underlying cause of a heart attack. Coronary arteries are the blood vessels that bring blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. Most heart attacks are caused by a blood clot that blocks one of the coronary arteries. When blood cannot reach part of your heart, that area starves for oxygen. If the blockage continues long enough, cells in the affected area die.) ",2791,0
What is (are) Defining overweight and obesity - children ?,"Obesity means having too much body fat. It is not the same as overweight, which means weighing too much. Obesity is becoming much more common in childhood. Most often, it begins between the ages of 5 and 6 and in adolescence.  Child health experts recommend that children be screened for obesity at age 2. If needed, they should be referred to weight-management programs.) ",2792,5

What causes Stroke ? (Also called: Cerebrovascular disease; CVA; Cerebral infarction; Cerebral hemorrhage; Ischemic stroke; Stroke - ischemic; Cerebrovascular accident; Stroke - hemorrhagic; Carotid artery - stroke),"There are two major types of stroke:   - Ischemic stroke  - Hemorrhagic stroke    Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel that supplies blood to the brain is blocked by a blood clot. This may happen in two ways:   - A clot may form in an artery that is already very narrow. This is called a thrombotic stroke.  - A clot may break off from another place in the blood vessels of the brain, or from some other part of the body, and travel up to the brain. This is called cerebral embolism, or an embolic stroke.    Ischemic strokes may also be caused by a sticky substance called plaque that can clog arteries.       Watch this video about:   Stroke         Watch this video about:   Stroke - secondary to cardiogenic embolism     A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in part of the brain becomes weak and bursts open. This causes blood to leak into the brain. Some people have defects in the blood vessels of the brain that make this more likely. These defects may include:   - Aneurysm  - Arteriovenous malformation (AVM)    Hemorrhagic strokes may also occur when someone is taking blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin). Very high blood pressure may cause blood vessels to burst, leading to hemorrhagic stroke.   An ischemic stroke can develop bleeding and become a hemorrhagic stroke.  High blood pressure is the main risk factor for strokes. Other major risk factors are:  - Irregular heartbeat, called atrial fibrillation  - Diabetes  - Family history of stroke  - High cholesterol  - Increasing age, especially after age 55  - Ethnicity (African Americans are more likely to die of a stroke)        Watch this video about:   Hypertension - overview     Stroke risk is also higher in:   - People who have heart disease or poor blood flow in their legs caused by narrowed arteries  - People who have unhealthy lifestyle habits such as smoking, a high-fat diet, and lack of exercise  - Women who take birth control pills (especially those who smoke and are older than 35)  - Women who are pregnant have an increased risk while pregnant  - Women who take hormone replacement therapy) ",2795,0
What are the symptoms of Stroke ? (Also called: Cerebrovascular disease; CVA; Cerebral infarction; Cerebral hemorrhage; Ischemic stroke; Stroke - ischemic; Cerebrovascular accident; Stroke - hemorrhagic; Carotid artery - stroke),"Symptoms of stroke depend on which part of the brain is damaged. In some cases, a person may not know that a stroke has occurred.   Most of the time, symptoms develop suddenly and without warning. But symptoms may occur on and off for the first day or two. Symptoms are usually most severe when the stroke first happens, but they may slowly get worse.   A headache may occur if the stroke is caused by bleeding in the brain. The headache:   - Starts suddenly and may be severe  - May be worse when you are lying flat  - Wakes you up from sleep  - Gets worse when you change positions or when you bend, strain, or cough     Other symptoms depend on how severe the stroke is, and what part of the brain is affected. Symptoms may include:  - Change in alertness (including sleepiness, unconsciousness, and coma)  - Changes in hearing or taste  - Changes that affect touch and the ability to feel pain, pressure, or different temperatures  - Confusion or loss of memory  - Problems swallowing  - Problems writing or reading  - Dizziness or abnormal feeling of movement (vertigo)  - Eyesight problems, such as decreased vision, double vision, or total loss of vision  - Lack of control over the bladder or bowels  - Loss of balance or coordination, or trouble walking  - Muscle weakness in the face, arm, or leg (usually just on one side)  - Numbness or tingling on one side of the body  - Personality, mood, or emotional changes  - Trouble speaking or understanding others who are speaking) ",2796,0
How to diagnose Stroke ?

Your doctor and nurses will repeat this exam over time to see if your stroke is getting worse or improving.  - Listen to the carotid arteries in the neck with a stethoscope for an abnormal sound, called a bruit, which is caused by abnormal blood flow.  - Check for high blood pressure.     You may have the following tests to help find the type, location, and cause of the stroke and rule out other problems:   - Angiogram of the head to look for a blood vessel that is blocked or bleeding  - Carotid duplex (ultrasound) to see if the carotid arteries in your neck have narrowed  - Echocardiogram to see if the stroke could have been caused by a blood clot from the heart  - Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or CT angiography to check for abnormal blood vessels in the brain    Other tests include:   - Blood tests  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rhythm monitoring) ",2797,0
What are the treatments for Stroke ? (Also called: Cerebrovascular disease; CVA; Cerebral infarction; Cerebral hemorrhage; Ischemic stroke; Stroke - ischemic; Cerebrovascular accident; Stroke - hemorrhagic; Carotid artery - stroke),"A stroke is a medical emergency. Quick treatment is needed. Call 9-1-1 or your local emergency number right away or seek urgent medical care at the first signs of a stroke.   People who are having stroke symptoms need to get to a hospital as quickly as possible.   - If the stroke is caused by a blood clot, a clot-busting drug may be given to dissolve the clot.  - To be effective, this treatment must be started within 3 to 4 1/2 hours of when the symptoms first started. The sooner this treatment is started, the better the chance of a good outcome.    Other treatments given in the hospital depend on the cause of the stroke. These may include:   - Blood thinners such as heparin, warfarin (Coumadin), aspirin, or clopidogrel (Plavix)  - Medicine to control risk factors, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol  - Special procedures or surgery to relieve symptoms or prevent more strokes  - Nutrients and fluids    Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and swallowing therapy will all begin in the hospital. If the person has severe swallowing problems, a feeding tube in the stomach (gastrostomy tube) will likely be needed.  The goal of treatment after a stroke is to help you recover as much function as possible and prevent future strokes.   Recovery from your stroke will begin while you are still in the hospital or at a rehabilitation center. It will continue when you go home from the hospital or center.

Many people who have had a stroke will keep improving in the months or years after their stroke.   Over half of people who have a stroke are able to function and live at home. Others are not able to care for themselves.  If treatment with clot-busting drugs is successful, the symptoms of a stroke may go away. However, patients often do not get to the hospital soon enough to receive these drugs, or they can't take these drugs because of a health condition.  People who have a stroke from a blood clot (ischemic stroke) have a better chance of surviving than those who have a stroke from bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke).  The risk for a second stroke is highest during the weeks or months after the first stroke. The risk begins to decrease after this period.) ",2800,0

What is (are) Ischemic Stroke ? (Also called: Embolic Stroke; Thrombotic stroke),"A stroke is a medical emergency. There are two types - ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke is the most common type. It is usually caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. This keeps blood from flowing to the brain. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die. Another cause is stenosis, or narrowing of the artery. This can happen because of atherosclerosis, a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) occur when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted briefly. Having a TIA can mean you are at risk for having a more serious stroke.    Symptoms of stroke are       - Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)    - Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech    - Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes    - Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination    - Sudden severe headache with no known cause       It is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible.

You may need to take medicines to lower your blood pressure if lifestyle changes are not enough to bring your blood pressure to the target level.   WHEN ARE MEDICINES FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE USED  Most of the time, your health care provider will try lifestyle changes first and check your BP 2 or more times. Medicines will likely be started if your BP readings remain at or above these levels:  - Top number (systolic pressure) of 140 or more in people younger than 60 years  - Top number of 150 or more in people 60 years and older  - Bottom number (diastolic pressure) of 90 or more    If you have diabetes, heart problems, or a history of a stroke, medicines may be started at lower blood pressure reading. The most commonly used blood pressure targets for people with these medical problems are below 130 to 140/80 mmHg.  MEDICINES FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE  Most of the time, only a single drug will be used at first. Two drugs may be started if your   - Systolic BP is above 160  - Diastolic BP is above 100    Several types of medicine are used to treat high blood pressure. Your provider will decide which type of medicine is right for you. You may need to take more than one type.  Each type of blood pressure medicine listed below comes in different brand and generic names.  One or more of these blood pressure medicines are often used to treat high blood pressure:  - Diuretics are also called water pills. They help your kidneys remove some salt (sodium) from your body. As a result, your blood vessels do not have to hold as much fluid and your blood pressure goes down.  - Beta-blockers make the heart beat at a slower rate and with less force.  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (also called ACE inhibitors) relax your blood vessels, which lowers your blood pressure.  - Angiotensin II receptor blockers (also called ARBs) work in about the same way as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.  - Calcium channel blockers relax blood vessels by stopping calcium from entering cells.    Blood pressure medicines that are not used as often include:  - Alpha-blockers help relax your blood vessels, which lowers your blood pressure.  - Centrally acting drugs signal your brain and nervous system to relax your blood vessels.  - Vasodilators signal the muscles in the walls of blood vessels to relax.  - Renin inhibitors, a newer type of medicine for treating high blood pressure, act by reducing the amount of angiotensin precursors thereby relaxing your blood vessels.    SIDE EFFECTS OF BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICINES  Most blood pressure medicines are easy to take, but all medicines have side effects. Most of these are mild and may go away over time.  Some common side effects of high blood pressure medicines include:  - Cough  - Diarrhea or constipation  - Dizziness or light-headedness  - Erection problems  - Feeling nervous  - Feeling tired, weak, drowsy, or a lack of energy  - Headache  - Nausea or vomiting  - Skin rash  - Weight loss or gain without trying    Tell your provider as soon as possible if you have side effects or the side effects are causing you problems. Most of the time, making changes to the dose of medicine or when you take it can help reduce side effects.   Never change the dose or stop taking a medicine on your own. Always talk to your provider first.  OTHER TIPS  Taking more than one medicine may change how your body absorbs or uses a drug. Vitamins or supplements, different foods, or alcohol may also change how a drug acts in your body.  Always ask your provider whether you need to avoid any foods, drinks, vitamins or supplements, or any other medicines while you are taking blood pressure medicine.) ",2813,0
Do you have information about Medicines for ADHD,"ADHD is a problem that most often affects children. Adults may be affected as well. People with ADHD may have problems with:   - Being able to focus  - Being over-active  - Not being able to control behavior    Medicines can help improve symptoms of ADHD. Talk or behavioral therapy can also help. Work closely with your health care providers to ensure that the treatment plan is successful. TYPES OF MEDICINES  Stimulants are the most commonly used type of ADHD medicine. Some medicines are taken more than one time a day, while others are taken only once a day. Your provider will decide which medicine is best.  Know the name and dose of each medicine you take. FINDING THE RIGHT MEDICINE AND DOSAGE  It is important to work with your provider to make sure the right medicine is given at the right dose.  Always take your medicine the way it was prescribed. Talk to your provider if a medicine is not controlling symptoms, or if you are having side effects. The dose may need to be changed, or a new medicine may need to be tried. MEDICINE TIPS  Some medicines for ADHD wear off over the day. Taking them before going to school or work may allow them to work when you need them the most. Your provider will advise you on this.  Other tips are:  - Refill your medicine before it runs out.  - Ask your provider whether your medicine should be taken with food or when there is no food in the stomach.  - DO NOT reduce your dose to save money. If you are having problems paying for medicine, talk with your provider. There may be programs that provide medicines for free or at a lower cost.   SAFETY TIPS FOR MEDICINE  Learn about the side effects of each medicine. Ask your provider what to do in case of side effects. Call your provider if you or your child notices side effects such as:  - Stomach pain  - Problems falling or staying asleep  - Eating less or weight-loss  - Tics or jerky movements  - Mood changes  - Unusual thoughts  - Hearing or seeing things that aren't there  - Fast heart beat    DO NOT use supplements or herbal remedies without checking with your provider. DO NOT use street drugs. Any of these may cause your ADHD medicines not to work as well.   Check with your provider about whether any other medicines should not be taken at the same time as ADHD medicines. MEDICINE TIPS FOR PARENTS  Regularly reinforce with your child the provider's treatment plan. Teach your child that these medicines can help him or her feel better and do better in school.  Children with ADHD often forget to take their medicines. Have your child set up a system, such as using a pill organizer. This can remind your child to take medicine.   Keep a close watch on possible side effects. Ask your child to tell you about any side effects. But be aware that your child may not understand when he or she is having side effects. Call the provider right away if your child does have side effects.  Be aware of possible drug abuse. Stimulant-type ADHD medicines can be dangerous in high doses. To ensure your child uses medicines safely:  - Talk to your child about the dangers of drug abuse.  - Teach your child not to share or sell their medicines.  - Monitor your child's medicines closely.)

Do you have information about Over-the-counter medicines (Also called: Medicines to have at home),"You can buy many medicines for minor problems at the store without a prescription (over-the-counter).   Important tips for using over-the-counter medicines:  - Always follow the printed directions and warnings. Talk to your health care provider before starting a new medicine.  - Know what you are taking. Look at the list of ingredients and choose products that have fewer items listed.  - All medicines become less effective over time and should be replaced. Check the expiration date before using any product.  - Store medicines in a cool, dry area. Keep all medicines out of the reach of children.    Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should talk to their provider before taking any new medicine.   Medicines affect children and older adults differently. People in these age groups should take special care when taking over-the-counter medicines.   Check with your provider before taking an over-the-counter medicine if:  - Your symptoms are very bad.  - You are not sure what is wrong with you.  - You have a long-term medical problem or you are taking prescription medicines.    ACHES, PAINS, AND HEADACHES   Over-the-counter pain medicines can help with headache, arthritis pain, sprains, and other minor joint and muscle problems.   - Acetaminophen. Try this medicine first for your pain. DO NOT take more than 4 grams (4,000 mg) on any 1 day.  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). You can buy some NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, without a prescription.    Both of these medicines can have serious side effects if you take them in high doses or for a long time. Tell your provider if you are taking these medicines many times a week. You may need to be checked for side effects.  FEVER   Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help reduce fever in children and adults.   - Take acetaminophen every 4 to 6 hours.  - Take ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours. DO NOT use ibuprofen in children younger than 6 months.  - Know how much you or your child weighs before giving these medicines.    Aspirin works very well for treating fever in adults. DO NOT give aspirin to a child unless your child's provider tells you it is OK. COLD, SORE THROAT, COUGH   Cold medicines can treat symptoms to make you feel better, but they do not shorten a cold. Taking zinc supplements within 24 hours of the start of a cold may reduce the symptoms and duration of a cold.   NOTE: Talk to your provider before giving your child any type of over-the-counter cold medicine, even if it is labeled for children.   Cough medicines:   - Guaifenesin: Helps break up mucus. Drink lots of fluids if you take this medicine.  - Menthol throat lozenges: Soothe ""tickle"" in the throat (Halls, Robitussin, Vicks).  - Liquid cough medicines with dextromethorphan: Suppress the urge to cough (Benylin, Delsym, Robitussin DM, Simply Cough, Vicks 44, and store brands).    Decongestants:  - Decongestants help clear a runny nose and relieve postnasal drip.  - Decongestant nasal sprays may work more quickly, but they can have a rebound effect if you use them for more than 3 to 5 days. Your symptoms may get worse if you keep using these sprays.  - Check with your provider before taking decongestants if you have high blood pressure or prostate problems.  - Oral decongestants: Pseudophedrine (Contac Non-Drowsy, Sudafed, and store brands); phenylephrine (Sudafed PE and store brands)  - Decongestant nasal sprays: Oxymetazoline (Afrin, Neo-Synephrine Nighttime, Sinex Spray); phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine, Sinex Capsules).    Sore throat medicines:  - Sprays to numb pain: Dyclonine (Cepacol); phenol (Chloraseptic).  - Painkillers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve).  - Hard candies that coat throat: Sucking on candy or throat lozenges can be soothing. Be careful in young children because of the choking risk.

What is (are) Taking medicines to treat tuberculosis ? (Also called: Tuberculosis - medicines; DOT; Directly observed therapy; TB - medicines),"Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious bacterial infection that involves the lungs, but may spread to other organs.  You may have a TB infection but no active disease or symptoms. This means the TB bacteria remain inactive (dormant) in a small area of your lungs. This type of infection may be present for years and is called latent TB. With latent TB:   - You cannot spread TB to other people.  - In some people, the bacteria can become active. If this happens, you may become sick or you can pass the TB germs to someone else.  - Even though you do not feel sick, you need to take medicines for TB for 6 to 9 months. This is the only way to make sure all of the TB bacteria in your body are killed.    When you have active TB, you may feel sick or have a cough, lose weight, feel tired, or have a fever or night sweats. In this case:  - You can pass TB to people around you. This includes people you live, work, or come in close contact with.  - You need to take medicines for TB for at least 6 months to rid your body of the TB bacteria. You should begin to feel better within a month of starting medicines.  - For the first 2 to 4 weeks after starting the medicines, you may need to stay home to avoid spreading TB to others. Ask your doctor when it is OK to be around others.  - Your doctor is required by law to report your case to the local public health department.    Ask your doctor whether others with whom you work or live should be tested for TB.) ",2817,2

What is (are) complement component 2 deficiency ? (Also called: C2 deficiency; C2D; complement 2 deficiency),"Complement component 2 deficiency is a disorder that causes the immune system to malfunction, resulting in a form of immunodeficiency. Immunodeficiencies are conditions in which the immune system is not able to protect the body effectively from foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. People with complement component 2 deficiency have a significantly increased risk of recurrent bacterial infections, specifically of the lungs (pneumonia), the membrane covering the brain and spinal cord (meningitis), and the blood (sepsis), which may be life-threatening. These infections most commonly occur in infancy and childhood and become less frequent in adolescence and adulthood.  Complement component 2 deficiency is also associated with an increased risk of developing autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or vasculitis. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and organs. Between 10 and 20 percent of individuals with complement component 2 deficiency develop SLE. Females with complement component 2 deficiency are more likely to have SLE than affected males, but this is also true of SLE in the general population.  The severity of complement component 2 deficiency varies widely. While some affected individuals experience recurrent infections and other immune system difficulties, others do not have any health problems related to the disorder.) ",2820,3
How many people are affected by complement component 2 deficiency ? (Also called: C2 deficiency; C2D; complement 2 deficiency),"In Western countries, complement component 2 deficiency is estimated to affect 1 in 20,000 individuals; its prevalence in other areas of the world is unknown.) ",2821,3
What are the genetic changes related to complement component 2 deficiency ? (Also called: C2 deficiency; C2D; complement 2 deficiency),"Complement component 2 deficiency is caused by mutations in the C2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making the complement component 2 protein, which helps regulate a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders, trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. The complement component 2 protein is involved in the pathway that turns on (activates) the complement system when foreign invaders, such as bacteria, are detected.  The most common C2 gene mutation, which is found in more than 90 percent of people with complement component 2 deficiency, prevents the production of complement component 2 protein. A lack of this protein impairs activation of the complement pathway. As a result, the complement system's ability to fight infections is diminished. It is unclear how complement component 2 deficiency leads to an increase in autoimmune disorders. Researchers speculate that the dysfunctional complement system is unable to distinguish what it should attack, and it sometimes attacks normal tissues, leading to autoimmunity. Alternatively, the dysfunctional complement system may perform partial attacks on invading molecules, which leaves behind foreign fragments that are difficult to distinguish from the body's tissues, so the complement system sometimes attacks the body's own cells. It is likely that other factors, both genetic and environmental, play a role in the variability of the signs and symptoms of complement component 2 deficiency.) ",2822,0
Is complement component 2 deficiency inherited ? (Also called: C2 deficiency; C2D; complement 2 deficiency),"This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.

What is (are) complement factor I deficiency ? (Also called: C3 inactivator deficiency; complement component 3 inactivator deficiency),"Complement factor I deficiency is a disorder that affects the immune system. People with this condition are prone to recurrent infections, including infections of the upper respiratory tract, ears, skin, and urinary tract. They may also contract more serious infections such as pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis, which may be life-threatening.  Some people with complement factor I deficiency have a kidney disorder called glomerulonephritis with isolated C3 deposits. Complement factor I deficiency can also be associated with autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and organs.) ",2824,6

What are the genetic changes related to complement factor I deficiency ? (Also called: C3 inactivator deficiency; complement component 3 inactivator deficiency),"Complement factor I deficiency is caused by mutations in the CFI gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called complement factor I. This protein helps regulate a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. This system must be carefully regulated so it targets only unwanted materials and does not attack the body's healthy cells. Complement factor I and several related proteins protect healthy cells by preventing activation of the complement system when it is not needed.  Mutations in the CFI gene that cause complement factor I deficiency result in abnormal, nonfunctional, or absent complement factor I. The lack (deficiency) of functional complement factor I protein allows uncontrolled activation of the complement system. The unregulated activity of the complement system decreases blood levels of another complement protein called C3, reducing the immune system's ability to fight infections. In addition, the immune system may malfunction and attack its own tissues, resulting in autoimmune disorders.) ",2826,0

Do you have information about Diabetes Medicines,"Diabetes means your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. If you can't control your diabetes with wise food choices and physical activity, you may need diabetes medicines. The kind of medicine you take depends on your type of diabetes, your schedule, and your other health conditions.     With type 1 diabetes, your pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much glucose stays in your blood. If you have type 1 diabetes, you will need to take insulin.     Type 2 diabetes, the most common type, can start when the body doesn't use insulin as it should. If your body can't keep up with the need for insulin, you may need to take pills. Along with meal planning and physical activity, diabetes pills help people with type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes keep their blood glucose levels on target. Several kinds of pills are available. Each works in a different way. Many people take two or three kinds of pills. Some people take combination pills. Combination pills contain two kinds of diabetes medicine in one tablet. Some people take pills and insulin.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) ",2828,5

Aside from drugs for fever or pain, most over-the-counter products haven't actually been studied in children for effectiveness, safety, or dosing.    When you give medicine to your child, be sure you're giving the right medicine and the right amount. Read and follow the label directions. Use the correct dosing device. If the label says two teaspoons and you're using a dosing cup with ounces only, don't guess. Get the proper measuring device. Don't substitute another item, such as a kitchen spoon. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care provider before giving two medicines at the same time. That way, you can avoid a possible overdose or an unwanted interaction.

What are the genetic changes related to autoimmune Addison disease ? (Also called: autoimmune Addison's disease; autoimmune adrenalitis; classic Addison disease; primary Addison disease),"The cause of autoimmune Addison disease is complex and not completely understood. A combination of environmental and genetic factors plays a role in the disorder, and changes in multiple genes are thought to affect the risk of developing the condition.  The genes that have been associated with autoimmune Addison disease participate in the body's immune response. The most commonly associated genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). Each HLA gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. The most well-known risk factor for autoimmune Addison disease is a variant of the HLA-DRB1 gene called HLA-DRB1*04:04. This and other disease-associated HLA gene variants likely contribute to an inappropriate immune response that leads to autoimmune Addison disease, although the mechanism is unknown.  Normally, the immune system responds only to proteins made by foreign invaders, not to the body's own proteins. In autoimmune Addison disease, however, an immune response is triggered by a normal adrenal gland protein, typically a protein called 21-hydroxylase. This protein plays a key role in producing certain hormones in the adrenal glands. The prolonged immune attack triggered by 21-hydroxylase damages the adrenal glands (specifically the outer layers of the glands known, collectively, as the adrenal cortex), preventing hormone production. A shortage of adrenal hormones (adrenal insufficiency) disrupts several normal functions in the body, leading to hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypotension, muscle cramps, skin hyperpigmentation and other features of autoimmune Addison disease.  Rarely, Addison disease is not caused by an autoimmune reaction. Other causes include infections that damage the adrenal glands, such as tuberculosis, or tumors in the adrenal glands. Addison disease can also be one of several features of other genetic conditions, including X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and autoimmune polyglandular syndrome, type 1, which are caused by mutations in other genes.)

What causes Autoimmune disorders ?,"The blood cells in the body's immune system help protect against harmful substances. Examples include bacteria, viruses, toxins, cancer cells, and blood and tissue from outside the body. These substances contain antigens. The immune system produces antibodies against these antigens that enable it to destroy these harmful substances.  When you have an autoimmune disorder, your immune system does not distinguish between healthy tissue and antigens. As a result, the body sets off a reaction that destroys normal tissues.   The exact cause of autoimmune disorders is unknown. One theory is that some microorganisms (such as bacteria or viruses) or drugs may trigger changes that confuse the immune system. This may happen more often in people who have genes that make them more prone to autoimmune disorders.  An autoimmune disorder may result in:  - The destruction of body tissue  - Abnormal growth of an organ  - Changes in organ function    An autoimmune disorder may affect one or more organ or tissue types. Areas often affected by autoimmune disorders include:  - Blood vessels  - Connective tissues  - Endocrine glands such as the thyroid or pancreas  - Joints  - Muscles  - Red blood cells  - Skin    A person may have more than one autoimmune disorder at the same time. Common autoimmune disorders include:  - Addison disease  - Celiac disease - sprue (gluten-sensitive enteropathy)  - Dermatomyositis  - Graves disease  - Hashimoto thyroiditis  - Multiple sclerosis  - Myasthenia gravis  - Pernicious anemia  - Reactive arthritis  - Rheumatoid arthritis  - Sjgren syndrome  - Systemic lupus erythematosus  - Type I diabetes) ",2835,6

What is (are) autoimmune Addison disease ? (Also called: autoimmune Addison's disease; autoimmune adrenalitis; classic Addison disease; primary Addison disease),"Autoimmune Addison disease affects the function of the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. It is classified as an autoimmune disorder because it results from a malfunctioning immune system that attacks the adrenal glands. As a result, the production of several hormones is disrupted, which affects many body systems.  The signs and symptoms of autoimmune Addison disease can begin at any time, although they most commonly begin between ages 30 and 50. Common features of this condition include extreme tiredness (fatigue), nausea, decreased appetite, and weight loss. In addition, many affected individuals have low blood pressure (hypotension), which can lead to dizziness when standing up quickly; muscle cramps; and a craving for salty foods. A characteristic feature of autoimmune Addison disease is abnormally dark areas of skin (hyperpigmentation), especially in regions that experience a lot of friction, such as the armpits, elbows, knuckles, and palm creases. The lips and the inside lining of the mouth can also be unusually dark. Because of an imbalance of hormones involved in development of sexual characteristics, women with this condition may lose their underarm and pubic hair.  Other signs and symptoms of autoimmune Addison disease include low levels of sugar (hypoglycemia) and sodium (hyponatremia) and high levels of potassium (hyperkalemia) in the blood. Affected individuals may also have a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) and an increase in the number of white blood cells (lymphocytosis), particularly those known as eosinophils (eosinophilia).  Autoimmune Addison disease can lead to a life-threatening adrenal crisis, characterized by vomiting, abdominal pain, back or leg cramps, and severe hypotension leading to shock. The adrenal crisis is often triggered by a stressor, such as surgery, trauma, or infection.

What is (are) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome ? (Also called: EDS; Ehlers Danlos disease),"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect the connective tissues that support the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. Defects in connective tissues cause the signs and symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which vary from mildly loose joints to life-threatening complications.  Previously, there were more than 10 recognized types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, differentiated by Roman numerals. In 1997, researchers proposed a simpler classification that reduced the number of major types to six and gave them descriptive names: the classical type (formerly types I and II), the hypermobility type (formerly type III), the vascular type (formerly type IV), the kyphoscoliosis type (formerly type VIA), the arthrochalasia type (formerly types VIIA and VIIB), and the dermatosparaxis type (formerly type VIIC). This six-type classification, known as the Villefranche nomenclature, is still commonly used. The types are distinguished by their signs and symptoms, their underlying genetic causes, and their patterns of inheritance. Since 1997, several additional forms of the condition have been described. These additional forms appear to be rare, affecting a small number of families, and most have not been well characterized.  Although all types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome affect the joints and skin, additional features vary by type. An unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility) occurs with most forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, particularly the hypermobility type. Infants with hypermobile joints often have weak muscle tone, which can delay the development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking. The loose joints are unstable and prone to dislocation and chronic pain. Hypermobility and dislocations of both hips at birth are characteristic features in infants with the arthrochalasia type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.  Many people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome have soft, velvety skin that is highly stretchy (elastic) and fragile. Affected individuals tend to bruise easily, and some types of the condition also cause abnormal scarring. People with the classical form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome experience wounds that split open with little bleeding and leave scars that widen over time to create characteristic ""cigarette paper"" scars. The dermatosparaxis type of the disorder is characterized by skin that sags and wrinkles. Extra (redundant) folds of skin may be present as affected children get older.  Some forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, notably the vascular type and to a lesser extent the kyphoscoliosis and classical types, can involve serious and potentially life-threatening complications due to unpredictable tearing (rupture) of blood vessels. This rupture can cause internal bleeding, stroke, and shock. The vascular type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is also associated with an increased risk of organ rupture, including tearing of the intestine and rupture of the uterus (womb) during pregnancy.

(Also called: EDS; Ehlers Danlos disease),"Although it is difficult to estimate the overall frequency of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the combined prevalence of all types of this condition may be about 1 in 5,000 individuals worldwide. The hypermobility and classical forms are most common; the hypermobility type may affect as many as 1 in 10,000 to 15,000 people, while the classical type probably occurs in 1 in 20,000 to 40,000 people.  Other forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are very rare. About 30 cases of the arthrochalasia type and about 60 cases of the kyphoscoliosis type have been reported worldwide. About a dozen infants and children with the dermatosparaxis type have been described. The vascular type is also rare; estimates vary widely, but the condition may affect about 1 in 250,000 people.) ",2861,3
What are the genetic changes related to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome ? (Also called: EDS; Ehlers Danlos disease),"Mutations in more than a dozen genes have been found to cause Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The classical type results most often from mutations in either the COL5A1 gene or the COL5A2 gene. Mutations in the TNXB gene have been found in a very small percentage of cases of the hypermobility type (although in most cases, the cause of this type is unknown). The vascular type results from mutations in the COL3A1 gene. PLOD1 gene mutations cause the kyphoscoliosis type. Mutations in the COL1A1 gene or the COL1A2 gene result in the arthrochalasia type. The dermatosparaxis type is caused by mutations in the ADAMTS2 gene. The other, less well-characterized forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome result from mutations in other genes, some of which have not been identified.  Some of the genes associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, including COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A1, and COL5A2, provide instructions for making pieces of several different types of collagen. These pieces assemble to form mature collagen molecules that give structure and strength to connective tissues throughout the body. Other genes, including ADAMTS2, PLOD1, and TNXB, provide instructions for making proteins that process or interact with collagen. Mutations that cause the different forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome disrupt the production or processing of collagen, preventing these molecules from being assembled properly. These defects weaken connective tissues in the skin, bones, and other parts of the body, resulting in the characteristic features of this condition.) ",2862,7
Is Ehlers-Danlos syndrome inherited ? (Also called: EDS; Ehlers Danlos disease),"The inheritance pattern of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome varies by type. The arthrochalasia, classical, hypermobility, and vascular forms of the disorder have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new (sporadic) gene mutations and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.  The dermatosparaxis and kyphoscoliosis types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, as well as some of the rare, less well-characterized types of the disorder, are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. In autosomal recessive inheritance, two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the altered gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder.) ",2863,7

Narrowing that occurs in the valve itself is called pulmonary valve stenosis. There may also be narrowing just before or after the valve.   The defect may occur alone or with other heart defects that are present at birth. The condition can be mild or severe.  Pulmonary valve stenosis is a rare disorder. In some cases, the problem runs in families.) ",2898,7
"What are the genetic changes related to supravalvular aortic stenosis ? (Also called: aortic stenosis, supravalvular; stenosis, aortic supravalvular; stenosis, supravalvular aortic; supravalvular stenosis, aortic; SVAS)","Mutations in the ELN gene cause SVAS. The ELN gene provides instructions for making a protein called tropoelastin. Multiple copies of the tropoelastin protein attach to one another and are processed to form a mature protein called elastin. Elastin is the major component of elastic fibers, which are slender bundles of proteins that provide strength and flexibility to connective tissue (tissue that supports the body's joints and organs). Elastic fibers are found in the intricate lattice that forms in the spaces between cells (the extracellular matrix), where they give structural support to organs and tissues such as the heart, skin, lungs, ligaments, and blood vessels. Elastic fibers make up approximately 50 percent of the aorta, the rest being primarily muscle cells called vascular smooth muscle cells that line the aorta. Together, elastic fibers and vascular smooth muscle cells provide flexibility and resilience to the aorta.  Most of the ELN gene mutations that cause SVAS lead to a decrease in the production of tropoelastin. A shortage of tropoelastin reduces the amount of mature elastin protein that is processed and available for forming elastic fibers. As a result, elastic fibers that make up the aorta are thinner than normal. To compensate, the smooth muscle cells that line the aorta increase in number, making the aorta thicker and narrower than usual. A thickened aorta is less flexible and resilient to the stress of constant blood flow and pumping of the heart. Over time, the wall of the aorta can become damaged. Aortic narrowing causes the heart to work harder to pump blood through the aorta, resulting in the signs and symptoms of SVAS.) ",2899,7

"What is (are) supravalvular aortic stenosis ? (Also called: aortic stenosis, supravalvular; stenosis, aortic supravalvular; stenosis, supravalvular aortic; supravalvular stenosis, aortic; SVAS)","Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) is a heart defect that develops before birth. This defect is a narrowing (stenosis) of the large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the aorta). The condition is described as supravalvular because the section of the aorta that is narrowed is located just above the valve that connects the aorta with the heart (the aortic valve). Some people with SVAS also have defects in other blood vessels, most commonly stenosis of the artery from the heart to the lungs (the pulmonary artery). An abnormal heart sound during a heartbeat (heart murmur) can often be heard during a chest exam. If SVAS is not treated, the aortic narrowing can lead to shortness of breath, chest pain, and ultimately heart failure.  The severity of SVAS varies considerably, even among family members. Some affected individuals die in infancy, while others never experience symptoms of the disorder.) ",2901,7

Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.) ",2903,7
What is (are) Aortic stenosis ? (Also called: Aortic valve stenosis; Rheumatic aortic stenosis; Calcific aortic stenosis),"The aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. Blood flows out of the heart and into the aorta through the aortic valve. In aortic stenosis, the aortic valve does not open fully. This decreases blood flow from the heart.) ",2904,7
What causes Aortic stenosis ? (Also called: Aortic valve stenosis; Rheumatic aortic stenosis; Calcific aortic stenosis),"As the aortic valve narrows, the left ventricle has to work harder to pump blood out through the valve. To do this extra work, the muscles in the ventricle walls become thicker. This can lead to chest pain.   As the pressure continues to rise, blood may back up into the lungs. Severe aortic stenosis can limit the amount of blood that reaches the brain and the rest of the body.  Aortic stenosis may be present from birth (congenital), but most often it develops later in life. Children with aortic stenosis may have other conditions present from birth.  Aortic stenosis mainly occurs due to the buildup of calcium deposits that narrow the valve. This is called calcific aortic stenosis. The problem mostly affects older people.   Calcification of the valve happens sooner in people who are born with abnormal aortic or bicuspid valves. In rare cases, calcification can develop more quickly when a person has received chest radiation (such as for cancer treatment).  Another cause is rheumatic fever. This condition can develop after strep throat or scarlet fever. Valve problems do not develop for 5 - 10 years or longer after rheumatic fever occurs. Rheumatic fever is becoming rarer in the United States.  Aortic stenosis occurs in about 2% of people over 65 years of age. It occurs more often in men than in women.) ",2905,7
What are the symptoms of Aortic stenosis ? (Also called: Aortic valve stenosis; Rheumatic aortic stenosis; Calcific aortic stenosis),"Most people with aortic stenosis do not develop symptoms until the disease is advanced. The diagnosis may have been made when the health care provider heard a heart murmur and performed tests.  Symptoms of aortic stenosis include:  - Chest discomfort: The chest pain may get worse with activity and reach into the arm, neck, or jaw. The chest may also feel tight or squeezed.  - Cough, possibly bloody  - Breathing problems when exercising  - Becoming easily tired  - Feeling the heart beat (palpitations)  - Fainting, weakness, or dizziness with activity   In infants and children, symptoms include:  - Becoming easily tired with exertion (in mild cases)  - Failure to gain weight  - Poor feeding  - Serious breathing problems that develop within days or weeks of birth (in severe cases)   Children with mild or moderate aortic stenosis may get worse as they get older. They are also at risk for a heart infection called bacterial endocarditis.) ",2906,8
How to diagnose Aortic stenosis ? (Also called: Aortic valve stenosis; Rheumatic aortic stenosis; Calcific aortic stenosis),"A heart murmur, click, or other abnormal sound is almost always heard through a stethoscope. The health care provider may be able to feel a vibration or movement when placing a hand over the heart. There may be a faint pulse or changes in the quality of the pulse in the neck.  Blood pressure may be low.  Aortic stenosis is most often detected and then followed using a test called an echocardiogram.  The following tests may also be performed:  - ECG  - Exercise stress testing  - Left cardiac catheterization  - MRI of the heart  - Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)) ",2907,7
What are the treatments for Aortic stenosis ? (Also called: Aortic valve stenosis; Rheumatic aortic stenosis; Calcific aortic stenosis),"Regular checkups by a health provider may be all that is needed if your symptoms are not severe. The health care provider should ask about your health history, do a physical exam, and perform an echocardiogram.  People with severe aortic stenosis may be told not to play competitive sports, even if they have no symptoms. If symptoms do occur, strenuous activity must often be limited.  Medicines are used to treat symptoms of heart failure or abnormal heart rhythms (most commonly atrial fibrillation). These include diuretics (water pills), nitrates, and beta-blockers. High blood pressure should also be treated. If aortic stenosis is severe, this treatment must be done carefully so blood pressure does not drop too far.  In the past, most people with heart valve problems were given antibiotics before dental work or a procedure such as colonoscopy. The antibiotics were given to prevent an infection of the damaged heart. However, antibiotics are now used much less often before dental work and other procedures. Check with your health care provider to find out whether you need antibiotics.  People with this and other heart conditions should stop smoking and be tested for high cholesterol.  Surgery to repair or replace the valve is often done for adults or children who develop symptoms. Even if symptoms are not very bad, the doctor may recommend surgery based on test results.  A less invasive procedure called balloon valvuloplasty may be done instead of surgery.  - A balloon is placed into an artery in the groin, threaded to the heart, placed across the valve, and inflated. However, narrowing often occurs again after this procedure.  - A newer procedure done at the same time as valvuloplasty can implant an artificial valve. This procedure is most often done in patients who cannot have surgery, but itis becoming more common.    Some children may need aortic valve repair or replacement. Children with mild aortic stenosis may be able to take part in most activities.) ",2908,8
What is the outlook for Aortic stenosis ? (Also called: Aortic valve stenosis; Rheumatic aortic stenosis; Calcific aortic stenosis),"The outcome varies. The disorder may be mild and not produce symptoms. Over time, the aortic valve may become narrower. This may result in more severe heart problems such as:   - Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter  - Blood clots to the brain (stroke), intestines, kidneys, or other areas  - Fainting spells (syncope)  - Heart failure  - High blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs (pulmonary hypertension)    The results of aortic valve replacement are often excellent. To get the best treatment, go to a center that regularly performs this type of surgery.) ",2909,7

Rarely, white sponge nevi also occur on the mucosae (singular: mucosa) of the nose, esophagus, genitals, or anus. The nevi are caused by a noncancerous (benign) overgrowth of cells.  White sponge nevus can be present from birth but usually first appears during early childhood. The size and location of the nevi can change over time. In the oral mucosa, both sides of the mouth are usually affected.

These genes provide instructions for making proteins called keratins. Keratins are a group of tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of epithelial cells, which are cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body and make up the different mucosae. The keratin 4 protein (produced from the KRT4 gene) and the keratin 13 protein (produced from the KRT13 gene) partner together to form molecules known as intermediate filaments. These filaments assemble into networks that provide strength and resilience to the different mucosae. Networks of intermediate filaments protect the mucosae from being damaged by friction or other everyday physical stresses.  Mutations in the KRT4 or KRT13 gene disrupt the structure of the keratin protein. As a result, keratin 4 and keratin 13 are mismatched and do not fit together properly, leading to the formation of irregular intermediate filaments that are easily damaged with little friction or trauma. Fragile intermediate filaments in the oral mucosa might be damaged when eating or brushing one's teeth. Damage to intermediate filaments leads to inflammation and promotes the abnormal growth and division (proliferation) of epithelial cells, causing the mucosae to thicken and resulting in white sponge nevus.)

One important type of white blood cell is the neutrophil. These cells are made in bone marrow and travel in the blood throughout the body. They sense infections, gather at sites of infection, and destroy the pathogens.   When the body has too few neutrophils, the condition is called neutropenia. This makes it harder for the body to fight off pathogens. As a result the person is more likely to get sick from infections. In general, an adult who has fewer than 1,000 neutrophils in a microliter of blood has neutropenia.  If the neutrophil count is very low, (fewer than 500 neutrophils in a microliter of blood), it is called severe neutropenia.

The symptoms include:  - Drowsiness  - Weakness and loss of coordination  - Pale and cold skin  - Confusion  - Uncontrollable shivering (although at extremely low body temperatures, shivering may stop)  - Slowed breathing or heart rate   Lethargy, cardiac arrest, shock, and coma can set in without prompt treatment. Hypothermia can be fatal.) ",2945,6
What to do for Hypothermia ? (Also called: Low body temperature; Cold exposure),"Take the following steps if you think someone has hypothermia:  - If the person has any symptoms of hypothermia are present, especially confusion or problems thinking, call 911 right away.  - If the person is unconscious, check airway, breathing, and circulation. If necessary, begin rescue breathing or CPR. If the victim is breathing fewer than 6 breaths per minute, begin rescue breathing.  - Take the person inside to room temperature and cover with warm blankets. If going indoors is not possible, get the person out of the wind and use a blanket to provide insulation from the cold ground. Cover the person's head and neck to help retain body heat.  - Once inside, remove any wet ortight clothes and replace them with dry clothing.  - Warm the person. If necessary, use your own body heat to aid the warming. Apply warm compresses to the neck, chest wall, and groin. If the person is alert and can easily swallow, give warm, sweetened, nonalcoholic fluids to aid the warming.  - Stay with the person until medical help arrives.) ",2946,6

What is (are) adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency ? (Also called: AMP deaminase deficiency; exercise-induced myopathy; MAD deficiency; MADA deficiency; muscle AMP deaminase deficiency; myoadenylate deaminase deficiency),"Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) deaminase deficiency is a condition that can affect the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). People with this condition do not make enough of an enzyme called AMP deaminase. In most people, AMP deaminase deficiency does not cause any symptoms. People who do experience symptoms typically have muscle pain (myalgia) or weakness after exercise or prolonged physical activity. They often get tired more quickly and stay tired longer than would normally be expected. Some affected individuals have more severe symptoms, but it is unclear whether these symptoms are due solely to a lack of AMP deaminase or additional factors. Muscle weakness is typically apparent beginning in childhood or early adulthood.  Researchers have proposed three types of AMP deaminase deficiency, which are distinguished by their symptoms and genetic cause.) ",2951,3
How many people are affected by adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency ? (Also called: AMP deaminase deficiency; exercise-induced myopathy; MAD deficiency; MADA deficiency; muscle AMP deaminase deficiency; myoadenylate deaminase deficiency),"AMP deaminase deficiency is one of the most common inherited muscle disorders in white populations, affecting 1 in 50 to 100 people. The prevalence is lower in African Americans, affecting an estimated 1 in 40,000 people, and the condition is even less common in the Japanese population.) ",2952,3
What are the genetic changes related to adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency ? (Also called: AMP deaminase deficiency; exercise-induced myopathy; MAD deficiency; MADA deficiency; muscle AMP deaminase deficiency; myoadenylate deaminase deficiency),"Mutations in the AMPD1 gene cause AMP deaminase deficiency. The AMPD1 gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called AMP deaminase. This enzyme is found in skeletal muscle, where it plays a role in producing energy within muscle cells. Mutations in the AMPD1 gene disrupt the function of AMP deaminase and impair the muscle cells' ability to produce energy. This lack of energy can lead to myalgia or other muscle problems associated with AMP deaminase deficiency.  The three types of AMP deaminase deficiency are known as the inherited type, acquired type, and coincidental inherited type.  Individuals with the inherited type have a mutation in both copies of the AMPD1 gene in each cell. Most people are asymptomatic, meaning they have no symptoms. Some people with AMP deaminase deficiency experience muscle weakness or pain following exercise.  The acquired type occurs in people who have decreased levels of AMP deaminase due to the presence of a muscle or joint condition.  People with the coincidental inherited type have a mutation in both copies of the AMPD1 gene. Additionally, they have a separate joint or muscle disorder. Some individuals experience more severe joint or muscle symptoms related to their disorder if they have AMP deaminase deficiency than do people without this enzyme deficiency. Most, however, do not have any symptoms associated with AMP deaminase deficiency.  It is not known why most people with this condition do not experience symptoms. Researchers speculate that additional mutations in other genes may be involved.) ",2953,3
Is adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency inherited ? (Also called: AMP deaminase deficiency; exercise-induced myopathy; MAD deficiency; MADA deficiency; muscle AMP deaminase deficiency; myoadenylate deaminase deficiency),"This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.) ",2954,7

What are the brand names of combination products of Glimepiride ?,"- Avandaryl (containing Glimepiride, Rosiglitazone)  - Duetact (containing Glimepiride, Pioglitazone)) ",2957,2
Who should get Glimepiride and why is it prescribed ?,"Glimepiride is used along with diet and exercise, and sometimes with other medications, to treat type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Glimepiride lowers blood sugar by causing the pancreas to produce insulin (a natural substance that is needed to break down sugar in the body) and helping the body use insulin efficiently. This medication will only help lower blood sugar in people whose bodies produce insulin naturally. Glimepiride is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious condition that may occur if high blood sugar is not treated).  Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Taking medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.) ",2958,0
How should Glimepiride be used and what is the dosage ?,"Glimepiride comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with breakfast or the first main meal of the day. To help you remember to take glimepiride, take it at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take glimepiride exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.  Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of glimepiride and gradually increase your dose if needed. After you have taken glimepiride for some time, glimepiride may not control your blood sugar as well as it did at the beginning of your treatment. Your doctor may adjust the dose of your medication as needed so that the medication will work best for you. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling and if your blood sugar test results have been higher or lower than normal at any time during your treatment.  Glimepiride helps control blood sugar but does not cure diabetes. Continue to take glimepiride even if you feel well. Do not stop taking glimepiride without talking to your doctor.) ",2959,9
What should I do if I forget a dose of Glimepiride ?,"Before you start to take glimepiride, ask you doctor what you should do if you forget to take a dose. Write these directions down so that you can refer to them later.  As a general rule, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.) ",2960,8
What are the side effects or risks of Glimepiride ?,"This medication may cause changes in your blood sugar. You should know the symptoms of low and high blood sugar and what to do if you have these symptoms. Glimepiride may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:   - dizziness  - nausea  Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately:   - yellowing of the skin or eyes  - light-colored stools  - dark urine  - pain in the upper right part of the stomach  - unusual bruising or bleeding  - diarrhea  - fever  - sore throat   Glimepiride may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.  If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).  In one study, people who took a medication similar to glimepiride to treat their diabetes were more likely to die of heart problems than people who were treated with insulin and diet changes. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking glimepiride.) ",2961,4
What to do in case of emergency or overdose of Glimepiride ?,"In case of overdose, call your local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222. If the victim has collapsed or is not breathing, call local emergency services at 911. Symptoms of overdose may include hypoglycemia symptoms as well as the following:   - seizures  - loss of consciousness) ",2962,5
What other information should I know about Glimepiride ?,"Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your fasting blood sugar levels and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) should be checked regularly to determine your response to glimepiride. Your doctor may order other lab tests to check your response to glimepiride. Your doctor will also tell you how to check your response to this medication by measuring your blood sugar levels at home. Follow these instructions carefully.  You should always wear a diabetic identification bracelet to be sure you get proper treatment in an emergency.  Do not let anyone else take your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription.  It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.) ",2963,9
What should I know about storage and disposal of Glimepiride ?,"Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children.
