\n","\n","Predict: !!!ia of antiphis b. \n","\n","\n","Patient: what is.  progressive familial heart block. \n","\n","Reference:  progressive familial heart block is a genetic condition that alters the normal beating of the heart. a normal heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals that move through the heart in a highly coordinated way. these signals begin a specialized cluster of cells called the sinoatrial node.  located in the heart's upper chambers.. from there, a group of cells called the atrioventricular node carries the electrical signals to another cluster of cells called the bundle of his. this bundle separates into multiple thin spindles called bundle branches, which carry electrical signals into the heart's lower chambers.. electrical impulses move from the sinoatrial node down to the bundle branches, stimulating a normal heartbeat in which the ventricles contract slightly later than the atria. heart block occurs when the electrical signaling is obstructed anywhere from the atria to the ventricles. in people with progressive familial heart block, the condition worsens over time: early in the disorder, the electrical signals are partially blocked, but the block eventually becomes complete, preventing any signals from passing through the heart. partial heart block causes a slow or irregular heartbeat. , and can lead to the buildup of scar tissue.  in the cells that carry electrical impulses. fibrosis contributes to the development of complete heart block, resulting in uncoordinated electrical signaling between the atria and the ventricles and inefficient pumping of blood in the heart. complete heart block can cause a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest. , shortness of breath, fainting. , or sudden cardiac arrest and death. progressive familial heart block can be divided into type i and type ii, with type i being further divided into types ia and ib. these types differ in where in the heart signaling is interrupted and the genetic cause. in types ia and ib, the heart block originates in the bundle branch, and in type ii, the heart block originates in the atrioventricular node. the different types of progressive familial heart block have similar signs and symptoms. most cases of heart block are not genetic and are not considered progressive familial heart block. the most common cause of heart block is fibrosis of the heart, which occurs a normal process of aging. other causes of heart block can include the use of certain medications or an infection of the heart tissue.) \n","\n","Predict: !!!are

syndrome. \n","\n","Reference:  the genetic cause of antiphospholipid syndrome is unknown. this condition is associated with the presence of three abnormal immune proteins.  in the blood: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-b2 glycoprotein i. antibodies normally bind to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction, but the antibodies in antiphospholipid syndrome attack normal human proteins. when these antibodies attach.  to proteins, the proteins change shape and bind to other molecules and receptors on the surface of cells. binding to cells, particularly immune cells, turns on.  the blood clotting pathway and other immune responses. the production of lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-b2 glycoprotein i may coincide with exposure to foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, that are similar to normal human proteins. exposure to these foreign invaders may cause the body to produce antibodies to fight the infection, but because the invaders are so similar to the body's own proteins, the antibodies also attack the human proteins. similar triggers may occur during pregnancy when a woman's physiology, particularly her immune system, adapts to accommodate the developing fetus. these changes during pregnancy may explain the high rate of affected females. certain genetic variations.  in a few genes have been found in people with antiphospholipid syndrome and may predispose individuals to produce the specific antibodies known to contribute to the formation of thromboses. however, the contribution of these genetic changes to the development of the condition is unclear. people who test positive for all three antibodies but have not had a thrombosis or recurrent miscarriages are said to be

body's immune response. the most commonly associated genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen.  complex. the hla complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders.. each hla gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. the most well-known risk factor for autoimmune addison disease is a variant of the hla-drb1 gene called hla-drb1. 04:04. this and other disease-associated hla gene variants likely contribute to an inappropriate immune response that leads to autoimmune addison disease, although the mechanism is unknown. normally, the immune system responds only to proteins made by foreign invaders, not to the body's own proteins. in autoimmune addison disease, however, an immune response is triggered by a normal adrenal gland protein, typically a protein called 21-hydroxylase. this protein plays a key role in producing certain hormones in the adrenal glands. the prolonged immune attack triggered by 21-hydroxylase damages the adrenal glands. , preventing hormone production. a shortage of adrenal hormones.  disrupts several normal functions in the body, leading to hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypotension, muscle cramps, skin hyperpigmentation and other features of autoimmune addison disease.

process. how severe your baby's problem is depends on when the interruption occurred. in general, the earlier development problems occur in the womb, the more serious the problem. problems in the development of a girl's reproductive organs may be caused by: - broken or missing genes.  - use of certain drugs during pregnancy for example, some babies may have a genetic defect that prevents their body from producing a substance called 21-hydroxylase. if a developing baby girl lacks this substance, she will be born with a uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes, but her external genitals will look like those found on boys. see: congenital adrenal hyperplasia certain drugs that the mother takes can pass into the baby's bloodstream and interfere with organ development. one drug known to do this diethylstilbestrol.. doctors once prescribed this medicine to pregnant women to prevent miscarriage and early labor. however, scientists learned that baby girls born to women who took this drug had an abnormally shaped uterus. the drug also increased the daughters' chances of developing a rare form of vaginal cancer. sometimes, a developmental disorder can be seen as soon as the baby is born. it may cause life-threatening conditions in the newborn. other times, the condition is not diagnosed until the girl is older. the reproductive tract develops close to the urinary tract and kidneys. it also develops at the same time as several other organs. as a result, developmental problems in the female reproductive tract sometimes occur with problems in other areas, including the urinary tract, kidneys, and lower spine. developmental disorders of the female reproductive tract include intersex and ambiguous genitalia. see the specific articles for information these conditions. other developmental disorders of the female reproductive tract include: - cloacal abnormalities - the cloaca is a tube-like structure. in the early stages of a baby's development, the urinary tract, rectum, and vagina all empty into this one tube. but, later in development, the three areas separate and have their own openings. if the cloaca persists a baby girl grows in the womb, all the openings do not form. for example, a baby may be born with only one opening on the bottom of the body near the rectal area. urine and feces cannot drain out of the body. this can cause severe pain, stomach swelling, and breathing problems. some cloacal abnormalities may cause a baby girl to look like she has a male's penis. these birth defects are rare. - problems with outer.  genitals - developmental problems may lead to a swollen clitoris or fused labia.. most other problems of the outer genitals are related to intersex or ambiguous genitalia. - imperforate hymen - the hymen is a thin tissue that partly covers the opening to the vagina. an imperforate hymen completely blocks the vaginal opening. this often leads to painful swelling of the vagina. sometimes, the hymen has only a very small opening or tiny small holes. this problem may not be discovered until puberty. some baby girls are born without a hymen. - ovarian problems - a baby girl may have an extra ovary, extra tissue attached to an ovary, or structures called ovotes that have both male and female tissue. - uterus and cervix problems- a baby girl may be born with an extra cervix and uterus, a half-formed uterus, or a blockage of the uterus. usually, girls born with half a uterus and half a vagina are missing the kidney on the same side of the body. - vaginal problems- a baby girl may be born without a vagina or have the vaginal opening blocked by a layer of cells that are higher up in the vagina than where the hymen is. a missing vagina is most often due to mayer-rokitansky-kster-hauser syndrome. in this syndrome,

these different chemicals have some similarities. but they may not have the same effects when taken as a dietary supplement. most of the scientific research on glucosamine has been done using glucosamine sulfate. see the separate listing for glucosamine sulfate. the information this page is about glucosamine hydrochloride. dietary supplements that contain glucosamine often contain additional ingredients. these additional ingredients are frequently chondroitin sulfate, msm, or shark cartilage. some people think these combinations work better than taking just glucosamine alone. so far, researchers have found no proof that combing the additional ingredients with glucosamine adds any benefit. products that contain glucosamine and glucosamine plus chondroitin vary a great deal. some do not contain what the label claims. the difference can range from 25% to 115. some products in the us that are labeled glucosamine sulfate are actually glucosamine hydrochloride with added sulfate. this product will likely have different effects than one containg glucosamine sulfate. people take glucosamine hydrochloride by mouth for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, glaucoma, a jaw

instructions for making a protein called gap junction beta 2, more commonly known as connexin 26. connexin 26 is a member of the connexin protein family. connexin proteins form channels called gap junctions that permit the transport of nutrients, charged atoms. , and signaling molecules between neighboring cells that are in contact with each other. gap junctions made with connexin 26 transport potassium ions and certain small molecules. connexin 26 is found in cells throughout the body, including the inner ear and the skin. in the inner ear, channels made from connexin 26 are found in a snail-shaped structure called the cochlea. these channels may help to maintain the proper level of potassium ions required for the conversion of sound waves to electrical nerve impulses. this conversion is essential for normal hearing. in addition, connexin 26 may be involved in the maturation of certain cells in the cochlea. connexin 26 also plays a role in the growth and maturation of the outermost layer of skin.. at least one gjb2 gene mutation has been identified in people with hid. this mutation changes a single protein building block.  in connexin 26. the mutation is thought to result in channels that constantly leak ions, which impairs the health of the cells and increases cell death. death of cells in the skin and the inner ear may underlie the signs and symptoms of hid. because the gjb2 gene mutation identified in people with hid also occurs in keratis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome. , a disorder with similar features and the addition of eye abnormalities, many

malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. without a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet, inflammation resulting from immune system overactivity may cause a wide variety of signs and symptoms involving many parts of the body. celiac disease can develop at any age after an individual starts eating foods containg gluten. the classic symptoms of the condition result from inflammation affecting the gastrointestinal tract. this inflammation damages the villi, which are small, finger-like projections that line the small intestine and provide a greatly increased surface area to absorb nutrients. in celiac disease, the villi become shortened and eventually flatten out. intestinal damage causes diarrhea and poor absorption of nutrients, which may lead to weight loss. abdominal pain, swelling. , and food intolerances are common in celiac disease. inflammation associated with celiac disease may lead to an increased risk of developing certain gastrointestinal cancers such as cancers of the small intestine or esophagus. inflammation and poor nutrient absorption may lead to problems affecting many other organs and systems of the body in affected individuals. these health problems may include iron deficiency that results in a low number of red blood cells. , vitamin deficiencies, low bone mineral density. , itchy skin rashes. , defects in the enamel of the teeth, chronic fatigue, joint pain, poor growth, delayed puberty, infertility, or repeated miscarriages. neurological problems have also been associated with celiac disease; these include migraine headaches, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. , and recurrent seizures.. many people with celiac disease have one or more of these varied health problems but do not have gastrointestinal symptoms. this form of the condition is called nonclassic celiac disease. researchers now believe that nonclassic celiac disease is actually more common than the classic form. celiac disease often goes undiagnosed because many of its signs and symptoms are nonspecific, which means they may occur in many disorders. most people who have one or more of these nonspecific health problems do not have celiac disease. on average, a diagnosis of celiac disease is not made until 6 to 10 years after symptoms begin. some people have silent celiac disease, in which they have no symptoms of the disorder. however, people with silent celiac disease do have immune proteins in their blood.  that are common in celiac disease. they also have inflammatory damage to their small intestine that can be detected with a biopsy. in a small number of cases, celiac disease does not improve with a gluten-free diet and progresses to a condition called refractory sprue. refractory sprue is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption of nutrients, and an increased risk of developing a type of cancer of the immune cells called t-cell lymphoma.) \n","\n","Predict: !!! i’t

\n","\n","\n","Patient: what causes otis media with effusion. \n","\n","Reference:  the eustachian tube connects the inside of the ear to the back of the throat. this tube helps drain fluid to prevent it from building up in the ear. the fluid drains from the tube and is swallowed. otis media with effusion.  and ear infections are connected in two ways: - after most ear infections have been treated, fluid.  remains in the middle ear for a few days or weeks. - when the eustachian tube is partially blocked, fluid builds up in the middle ear. bacteria inside the ear become trapped and begin to grow. this may lead to an ear infection. the following can cause swelling of the eustachian tube ling that leads to increased fluid: - allergies - irritants.  - respiratory infections the following can cause the eustachian tube to close or become blocked: - drinking while lying on your back - sudden increases in air pressure.  getting water in a baby's ears will not lead to a blocked tube. ome is most common in winter or early spring, but it can occur at any time of year. it can affect people of any age. it occurs most often in children under age 2, but is rare in newborns. younger children get ome more often than older children or adults for several reasons: - the tube is shorter, more horizontal, and straighter, making it easier for bacteria to enter. - the tube is floppier, with a tinier opening that's easy to block. - young children get more colds because it takes time for the immune system to be able to recognize and ward off cold viruses. the fluid in ome is often thin and watery. in the past, it was thought that the fluid got thicker the longer it was present in the ear.  however, fluid thickness is now thought to berelated to the ear itself, rather than to how long the fluid is present.) \n","\n","Predict: !!! media with trisomy 13. \n","\n","\n","Patient: is grocery shopping safe during the coronavirus pandemic \n","\n","Reference:  it’s best not to make
